Transparent and accurate reporting is vital to this process; it allows readers to assess the reliability of the findings and repeat or build upon the work of other researchers. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) were developed in 2010 to help authors and journals identify the minimum information necessary to report in publications describing in vivo experiments. Despite widespread endorsement by the scientific community, the impact of ARRIVE on the transparency of reporting in animal research publications has been limited. We have revised the ARRIVE guidelines to update them and facilitate their use in practice. The revised guidelines are published alongside this paper. This explanation and elaboration document was developed as part of the revision. It provides further information about each of the 21 items in ARRIVE 2.0, including the rationale and supporting evidence for their inclusion in the guidelines, elaboration of details to report, and examples of good reporting from the published literature.

Yet, the scarcity of high-quality algorithms prevents from developing them further and being used in a real-time scenario. Patch-based techniques have been used to forecast the quality of an image, but they typically award the picture quality score to an individual patch of the image. As a result, there would be a lot of misleading scores coming from patches. Some regions of the image are important and can contribute highly toward the right prediction of its quality. To prevent outlier regions, we suggest a technique with a visual saliency module which allows the only important region to bypass to the neural network and allows the network to only learn the important information required to predict the quality. The neural network architecture used in this study is Inception-ResNet-v2. We assess the proposed strategy using a benchmark database (KADID-10k) to show its efficacy. The outcome demonstrates better performance compared with certain popular no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) and full-reference IQA (FR-IQA) approaches.

Talwalkar (Chair, AASLD), Hari S. Conjeevaram, Michael Porayko, Raphael B. Merriman, Peter L.M. Jansen, and Fabien Zoulim. This guideline has been approved by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver and represents the position of both associations. These recommendations provide a data-supported approach. They are based on the following: (1) formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature on the topic; (2) guideline policies covered by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/European Association for the Study of the Liver (AASLD/EASL) Policy on the Joint Development and Use of Practice Guidelines; and (3) the experience of the authors in the specified topic. Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information. To more fully characterize the available evidence supporting the recommendations, the AASLD/EASL Practice Guidelines Subcommittee has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup, with minor modifications (Table 1). The classifications and recommendations are based on three categories: the source of evidence in levels I through III; the quality of evidence designated by high (A), moderate (B), or low quality (C); and the strength of recommendations classified as strong (1) or weak (2). The literature databases and search strategies are outlined below. The resulting literature database was available to all members of the writing group (i.e., the authors). They selected references within their field of expertise and experience and graded the references according to the GRADE system.1 The selection of references for the guideline was based on a validation of the appropriateness of the study design for the stated purpose, a relevant number of patients under study, and confidence in the participating centers and authors. References on original data were preferred and those that were found unsatisfactory in any of these respects were excluded from further evaluation. There may be limitations in this approach when recommendations are needed on rare problems or problems on which scant original data are available. In such cases, it may be necessary to rely on less-qualified references with a low grading. As a result of the important changes in the treatment of complications of cirrhosis (renal failure, infections, and variceal bleeding [VB]), studies performed more than 30 years ago have generally not been considered for these guidelines. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent complication and one of the most debilitating manifestations of liver disease, severely affecting the lives of patients and their caregivers. Furthermore, cognitive impairment associated with cirrhosis results in utilization of more health care resources in adults than other manifestations of liver disease.2 Progress in the area has been hindered by the complex pathogenesis that is not yet fully elucidated. Apart from such biological factors, there remains the larger obstacle that there are no universally accepted standards for the definition, diagnosis, classification, or treatment of HE, mostly as a result of insufficient clinical studies and standardized definitions. Clinical management tends to be dependent on local standards and personal views. This is an unfavorable situation for patients and contrasts with the severity of the condition and the high level of standardization in other complications of cirrhosis. The lack of consistency in the nomenclature and general standards renders comparisons among studies and patient populations difficult, introduces bias, and hinders progress in clinical research for HE. The latest attempts to standardize the nomenclature were published in 2002 and suggestions for the design of HE trials in 2011. Because there is an unmet need for recommendations on the clinical management of HE, the EASL and the AASLD jointly agreed to create these practice guidelines. It is beyond the scope of these guidelines to elaborate on the theories of pathogenesis of HE, as well as the management of encephalopathy resulting from acute liver failure (ALF), which has been published as guidelines recently. Rather, its aim is to present standardized terminology and recommendations to all health care workers who have patients with HE, regardless of their medical discipline, and focus on adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD), which is, by far, the most frequent scenario. As these guidelines on HE were created, the authors found a limited amount of high-quality evidence to extract from the existing literature. There are many reasons for this; the elusive character of HE is among them, as well as the lack of generally accepted and utilized terms for description and categorization of HE. This makes a practice guideline all the more necessary for future improvement of clinical studies and, subsequently, the quality of management of patients with HE. With the existing body of evidence, these guidelines encompass the authors' best, carefully considered opinions. Although not all readers may necessarily agree with all aspects of the guidelines, their creation and adherence to them is the best way forward, with future adjustments when there is emergence of new evidence. Advanced liver disease and portosystemic shunting (PSS), far from being an isolated disorder of the liver, have well-known consequences on the body and, notably, on brain functioning. The alterations of brain functioning, which can produce behavioral, cognitive, and motor effects, were termed portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE)3 and later included in the term HE.4 Unless the underlying liver disease is successfully treated, HE is associated with poor survival and a high risk of recurrence.5, 6 Even in its mildest form, HE reduces health-related quality of life and is a risk factor for bouts of severe HE.7-9 Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction caused by liver it as a of or from alterations to This definition, in with is based on the that are of brain and that the a to liver The and of HE are to the severity of the underlying liver and In patients with fully HE is an that the of the disease, such as or encephalopathy is in cirrhosis with The of HE may not be an clinical and there are used for its which the in the and The of the of of cirrhosis is in in those with and in patients with portosystemic The that in of those with cirrhosis their clinical and in the in most HE or HE in of patients with The of HE in is not well The risk for the of is within years cirrhosis diagnosis, on the of risk factors, such as other complications to cirrhosis or infections, or and and with a of were found to have a risk of and with have a risk of within 6 Even with cirrhosis and cognitive dysfunction or one of years of the of is and is by the patient selection data were by It an of the frequent of the health care by patients with HE that for in the in the European are not these are to be Furthermore, the of and cirrhosis is and more be to further the of HE.

In this work, to address this issue, we presented a new NR-IQA framework combining global and local information for CT images. For simplicity, the NR-IQA framework is termed as NR-GL-IQA. In particular, the presented NR- GL-IQA adopts a convolutional neural network to predict entire image quality blindly without a reference image. In this stage, an elaborate strategy is used to automatically label the entire image quality for neural network training to cope with the problem of time-consuming in manually massive CT images annotation. Second, in the presented NR-GL-IQA method, Perception-based Image QUality Evaluator (PIQUE) is used to predict the local region quality because the PIQUE can adaptively capture the local region characteristics.

Existing knowledge distillation methods in image restoration typically employ lightweight student models that directly mimic the intermediate features and reconstruction results of the teacher, overlooking the implicit attention relationships between them. To address this, we propose a Soft Knowledge Distillation (SKD) strategy that incorporates a Multi-dimensional Cross-net Attention (MCA) mechanism for compressing image restoration models. This mechanism facilitates interaction between the student and teacher across both channel and spatial dimensions, enabling the student to implicitly learn the attention matrices.

We formulate the offloading problem as the joint optimization of the radio resources-the transmit precoding matrices of the MUs-and the computational resources-the CPU cycles/second assigned by the cloud to each MU-in order to minimize the overall users' energy consumption, while meeting latency constraints. The resulting optimization problem is nonconvex (in the objective function and constraints). Nevertheless, in the single-user case, we are able to compute the global optimal solution in closed form. In the more challenging multiuser scenario, we propose an iterative algorithm, based on a novel successive convex approximation technique, converging to a local optimal solution of the original nonconvex problem.

SLKD introduces a dual-teacher, single-student architecture that integrates two complementary learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL). In DRL, the student encoder learns to eliminate degradation factors by mimicking Teacher A, which processes degraded images utilizing a BRISQUE-based extractor to capture degradation-sensitive natural scene statistics. Concurrently, in IRL, the student decoder reconstructs clean images by learning from Teacher B, which processes clean images, guided by a PIQE-based extractor that emphasizes the preservation of edge and texture features essential for high-quality reconstruction. This dual-teacher approach enables the student model to learn from both degraded and clean images simultaneously, achieving robust image restoration while significantly reducing computational complexity.

The PRN is learned from real and synthetic image-agnostic perturbations, where an efficient method to compute the latter is also proposed.

To tackle these issues, a DMFA-DeepLab model integrating perception-driven enhancement is proposed. First, a physical perception degradation data generation method is developed based on the CycleGAN framework to simulate optical degradation features caused by rain and fog, thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability in adverse environmental conditions. Second, a multi-scale convolutional attention module (MCAM) is designed, which captures cross-scale features through heterogeneous convolution branches with receptive fields of 3, 5, and 9. The module further incorporates a channel-spatial dual attention mechanism to dynamically focus on key regions while suppressing background interference. Based on MCAM, a multi-level feature aggregation network (MFA-Net) is constructed, which enhances boundary description through cross-level feature fusion. To achieve model lightweighting, a two-stage pruning–knowledge distillation strategy is introduced: initially, 30% of low-contribution channels are pruned based on the BN scaling factor through sparse training; after a second pruning of 20%, the cumulative compression rate reaches 44%. Finally, knowledge distillation is applied, where the original model serves as the teacher to guide the student model in performance restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that on the enhanced dataset simulating rain and fog environments, the complete model achieves an MIoU of 93.17%, representing an improvement of 7.04% over the baseline DeepLabV3+. The lightweight model DMFA-DeepLab, while reducing the parameter count by 44%, restores the MIoU to 92.96% and increases inference speed by 2.3 times.

Benefiting from diversified modern medical measurement equipment, a large number of medical images will be produced in the clinical process. These images improve the diagnostic accuracy of doctors, but also increase the labor burden of doctors.

The objective of this procedure is the extraction of any compounds that can be carried out from the inner solid material to the outlet, resulting in a solution containing colorants, bioactive compounds, odorous substances, etc. Over the years, in the extraction techniques sector, there have been many important changes from the points of view of production, quality, and human and environmental safety due to improvements in technology. In more recent times, the interest of the scientific community has been aimed at the study of sustainable processes for the valorization of extracts from vegetables and food by-products, through the use of non-conventional (innovative) technologies that represent a valid alternative to conventional methods, generally through saving time and energy and the formation of fewer by-products. Therefore, with the development of principles based on the prevention of pollution, on a lower risk for human health, and on a low environmental impact, new systems have been implemented to reduce extraction times and solvent consumption, to improve efficiency, and to increase the productivity of the extracts. From this point of view, rapid solid-liquid dynamic extraction (RSLDE), performed using the Naviglio extractor, compared to traditional applications, is a technique that is able to reduce extraction times, generally leads to higher yields, does not require heating of the system, allows one to extract the active ingredients, and avoids their degradation. This technique is based on a new solid-liquid extraction principle named Naviglio's principle.

However, many previous knowledge distillation methods are designed for image classification and fail in more challenging tasks such as object detection. In this paper, we first suggest that the failure of knowledge distillation on object detection is mainly caused by two reasons: (1) the imbalance between pixels of foreground and background and (2) lack of knowledge distillation on the relation among different pixels. Then, we propose a structured knowledge distillation scheme, including attention-guided distillation and non-local distillation to address the two issues, respectively. Attention-guided distillation is proposed to find the crucial pixels of foreground objects with an attention mechanism and then make the students take more effort to learn their features. Non-local distillation is proposed to enable students to learn not only the feature of an individual pixel but also the relation between different pixels captured by non-local modules. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on thirteen kinds of object detection models with twelve comparison methods for both object detection and instance segmentation. For instance, Faster RCNN with our distillation achieves 43.9 mAP on MS COCO2017, which is 4.1 higher than the baseline.

One such class of biopolymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), are biosynthesized by numerous microorganisms through the conversion of carbon-rich renewable resources. PHA homo- and heteropolyesters are intracellular products of secondary microbial metabolism. When isolated from microbial biomass, PHA biopolymers mimic the functionalities of many of the top-selling plastics of petrochemical origin, but biodegrade in soil, freshwater, and marine environments, and are both industrial- and home-compostable. Only a handful of PHA biopolymers have been studied in-depth, and five of these reliably match the desired material properties of established fossil plastics. Realizing the positive attributes of PHA biopolymers, several established chemical companies and numerous start-ups, brand owners, and converters have begun to produce and use PHA in a variety of industrial and consumer applications, in what can be described as the emergence of the \"PHA industry\". While this positive industrial and commercial relevance of PHA can hardly be described as the first wave in its commercial development, it is nonetheless a very serious one with over 25 companies and start-ups and 30+ brand owners announcing partnerships in PHA production and use. The combined product portfolio of the producing companies is restricted to five types of PHA, namely poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), poly(4-hydroxybutyrate), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-<i>co</i>-3-hydroxyvalerate), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-<i>co</i>-4-hydroxybutyrate), and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-<i>co</i>-3-hydroxyhexanoate), even though PHAs as a class of polymers offer the potential to generate almost limitless combinations of polymers beneficial to humankind. To date, by varying the co-monomer type and content in these PHA biopolymers, their properties emulate those of the seven top-selling fossil plastics, representing 230 million t of annual plastics production. Capacity expansions of 1.5 million t over the next 5 years have been announced. Policymakers worldwide have taken notice and are encouraging industry to adopt biodegradable and compostable material solutions. This wave of commercialization of PHAs in single-use and in durable applications holds the potential to make the decisive quantum leap in reducing plastic pollution, the depletion of fossil resources, and the emission of greenhouse gases and thus fighting climate change.

In recent years, with the vigorous development of deep learning, this technology has been widely used in many fields. In the field of image super-resolution reconstruction, more and more methods based on deep learning have been studied. According to the principle of GAN, a pseudo high-resolution image is generated by the generator, and then the discriminator calculates the difference between the image and the real high-resolution image to measure the authenticity of the image. Based on SRGAN (super resolution general adverse network), this paper mainly makes three improvements. First, it introduces the attention channel mechanism, that is, it adds Ca (channel attention) module to SRGAN network, and increases the network depth to better express high frequency features; Second, delete the original BN (batch normalization) layer to improve the network performance; Third, modify the loss function to reduce the impact of noise on the image. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the current methods in both quantitative and qualitative indicators, and promotes the recovery of high-frequency detail information.

Nonetheless, the target encoders employed in previous studies exhibit computational complexity that increases quadratically with the input length, thereby limiting their practical utility. To overcome this challenge, we adopt a hint-based learning strategy to develop a compact and efficient target encoder.

The current method used in the measurement of TDS and TSS includes conventional field and gravimetric approaches. These methods are limited due to the associated cost and labor, and limited spatial coverages. Remote Sensing (RS) applications have, however, been used over the past few decades as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Although they also present underlying atmospheric interferences in images, radiometric and spectral resolution issues. Studies of these WQPs with RS, therefore, require the knowledge and utilization of the best mechanisms. The use of RS for retrieval of TDS, TSS, and their forms has been explored in many studies using images from airborne sensors onboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite sensors such as those onboard the Landsat, Sentinel-2, Aqua, and Terra platforms. The images and their spectral properties serve as inputs for deep learning analysis and statistical, and machine learning models. Methods used to retrieve these WQP measurements are dependent on the optical properties of the inland water bodies. While TSS is an optically active parameter, TDS is optically inactive with a low signal–noise ratio. The detection of TDS in the visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands is due to some process that (usually) co-occurs with changes in the TDS that is affecting a WQP that is optically active. This study revealed significant improvements in incorporating RS and conventional approaches in estimating WQPs. The findings reveal that improved spatiotemporal resolution has the potential to effectively detect changes in the WQPs. For effective monitoring of TDS and TSS using RS, we recommend employing atmospheric correction mechanisms to reduce image atmospheric interference, exploration of the fusion of optical and microwave bands, high-resolution hyperspectral images, utilization of ML and deep learning models, calibration and validation using observed data measured from conventional methods. Further studies could focus on the development of new technology and sensors using UAVs and satellite images to produce real-time in situ monitoring of TDS and TSS.

To this end, rich local-global information representations are increasingly indispensable for better satisfying rain removal. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Hybrid CNN-Transformer Feature Fusion Network (dubbed as HCT-FFN) in a stage-by-stage progressive manner, which can harmonize these two architectures to help image restoration by leveraging their individual learning strengths. Specifically, we stack a sequence of the degradation-aware mixture of experts (DaMoE) modules in the CNN-based stage, where appropriate local experts adaptively enable the model to emphasize spatially-varying rain distribution features. As for the Transformer-based stage, a background-aware vision Transformer (BaViT) module is employed to complement spatially-long feature dependencies of images, so as to achieve global texture recovery while preserving the required structure. Considering the indeterminate knowledge discrepancy among CNN features and Transformer features, we introduce an interactive fusion branch at adjacent stages to further facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality deraining results.

The goals and applications of inpainting are numerous, from the restoration of damaged paintings and photographs to the removal/replacement of selected objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for digital inpainting of still images that attempts to replicate the basic techniques used by professional restorators. After the user selects the regions to be restored, the algorithm automatically fills-in these regions with information surrounding them. The fill-in is done in such a way that isophote lines arriving at the regions' boundaries are completed inside. In contrast with previous approaches, the technique here introduced does not require the user to specify where the novel information comes from. This is automatically done (and in a fast way), thereby allowing to simultaneously fill-in numerous regions containing completely different structures and surrounding backgrounds. In addition, no limitations are imposed on the topology of the region to be inpainted.

This exposed matrix is prone to slow hydrolytic degradation by host collagenolytic enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cysteine cathepsins. Here we review the recent findings demonstrating that inhibition of salivary or dentin endogenous collagenolytic enzymes may provide preventive means against progression of caries or erosion, just as they have been shown to retain the integrity and improve the longevity of resin composite filling bonding to dentin. This paper also presents the case that the organic matrix in caries-affected dentin may not be preserved as intact as previously considered. In partially demineralized dentin, MMPs and cysteine cathepsins with the ability to cleave off the terminal non-helical ends of collagen molecules (telopeptides) may lead to the gradual loss of intramolecular gap areas. This would seriously compromise the matrix ability for intrafibrillar remineralization, which is considered essential in restoring the dentin's mechanical properties. More detailed data of the enzymes responsible and their detailed function in dentin-destructive conditions may not only help to find new and better preventive means, but better preservation of demineralized dentin collagenous matrix may also facilitate true biological remineralization for the better restoration of tooth structural and mechanical integrity and mechanical properties.", "authors": ["Leo Tjäderhane", "Marília Afonso Rabelo Buzalaf", "Marcela Carrilho", "Catherine Chaussain"], "year": 2015, "venue": "Caries Research", "cited_by_count": 2307, "type": "review", "concepts": ["Adhesive", "Dentin", "Methacrylate", "Materials science", "Composite material"], "search_query": "spatially varying degradation image restoration local"}

We describe two spatial applications for which Gaussian distributional assumptions are clearly inappropriate. The first concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Pacific island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a conventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity. The second application provides a description of spatial variation in the risk of campylobacter infections relative to other enteric infections in part of north Lancashire and south Cumbria. For this application, we treat the data as binomial counts at unit postcode locations, conditionally on an unobserved relative risk surface which we estimate. The theoretical framework for our extension of geostatistical methods is that, conditionally on the unobserved process S(x), observations at sample locations xi form a generalized linear model with the corresponding values of S(xi) appearing as an offset term in the linear predictor.

Variation in plant functional traits, and trait syndromes, has proven useful for tackling many important ecological questions at a range of scales, giving rise to a demand for standardised ways to measure ecologically meaningful plant traits. This line of research has been among the most fruitful avenues for understanding ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes. It also has the potential both to build a predictive set of local, regional and global relationships between plants and environment and to quantify a wide range of natural and human-driven processes, including changes in biodiversity, the impacts of species invasions, alterations in biogeochemical processes and vegetation–atmosphere interactions. The importance of these topics dictates the urgent need for more and better data, and increases the value of standardised protocols for quantifying trait variation of different species, in particular for traits with power to predict plant- and ecosystem-level processes, and for traits that can be measured relatively easily. Updated and expanded from the widely used previous version, this handbook retains the focus on clearly presented, widely applicable, step-by-step recipes, with a minimum of text on theory, and not only includes updated methods for the traits previously covered, but also introduces many new protocols for further traits. This new handbook has a better balance between whole-plant traits, leaf traits, root and stem traits and regenerative traits, and puts particular emphasis on traits important for predicting species’ effects on key ecosystem properties.

Studying the restoration potential (R) of the grasslands on the TP is crucial to the conservation and restoration of its alpine grassland ecosystems. Few studies have assessed the restoration value of the alpine grasslands on the TP. We attempt to estimate the actual (ANPP) and potential net primary productivity (PNPP) of the grasslands on the TP. On this basis, we defined R as the “gap” between the current and highest achievable levels of restoration of a grassland. Then, R estimates were yielded for the alpine grasslands on the TP, which we used to analyze the restoration value of these grasslands. Specifically, based on the meteorological data for the period 2001–2019, in conjunction with remote-sensing imagery acquired by a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer for the same period, the Carnegie–Ames–Stanford approach model was selected to produce ANPP estimates for the grasslands on the TP. Then, the Thornthwaite memorial model, the principle of similar habitats, and the Chikugo model, were employed to generate PNPP estimates for these grasslands. In addition, the R of these grasslands was then assessed based on the difference between their PNPP and ANPP. The main results are summarized as follows. (1) A multiyear mean R of 332.33 g C·m–2 (81.59% of the ANPP) was determined for the grasslands on the TP over the period 2001–2019. A notable spatial distribution pattern of high Rs in the southwestern, eastern and middle parts of the TP, and low Rs in the northwestern part of the TP were also identified. Most of the grasslands in areas such as the southern part of Nagqu, the southwestern part of Ngari, Xigaze, Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture were found to have high restoration value. (2) Grasslands with a stable R account were the highest proportion (76.13%) of all the grasslands on the TP, followed by those with a decreasing R (19.62%) and those with an increasing R (4.24%). Grasslands with an increasing R were mainly concentrated in the southern part of Xigaze, and parts of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. (3) Analysis based on the local conditions of the TP revealed a high restoration value for three types of grassland (i.e., alpine meadows, mountain meadows, and temperate meadow steppes), the grasslands distributed at altitudes of 3000–4000 m, and the grasslands located in the warm temperate zone. The results of this study are expected to provide scientific and theoretical support for the formulation of policies and measures aimed at conserving grasslands, as well as restoring ecosystems and degraded grasslands on the TP.", "authors": ["Ruijing Wang", "Qisheng Feng", "Zheren Jin", "Tiangang Liang"], "year": 2021, "venue": "Remote Sensing", "cited_by_count": 13, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Grassland", "Environmental science", "Primary production", "Grassland ecosystem", "Grassland degradation"], "search_query": "spatially varying degradation image restoration local"}

However, the past 15 yr have seen the emergence of the microbiota (the trillions of microorganisms within and on our bodies) as one of the key regulators of gut-brain function and has led to the appreciation of the importance of a distinct microbiota-gut-brain axis. This axis is gaining ever more traction in fields investigating the biological and physiological basis of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, age-related, and neurodegenerative disorders. The microbiota and the brain communicate with each other via various routes including the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, the vagus nerve and the enteric nervous system, involving microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, branched chain amino acids, and peptidoglycans. Many factors can influence microbiota composition in early life, including infection, mode of birth delivery, use of antibiotic medications, the nature of nutritional provision, environmental stressors, and host genetics. At the other extreme of life, microbial diversity diminishes with aging. Stress, in particular, can significantly impact the microbiota-gut-brain axis at all stages of life. Much recent work has implicated the gut microbiota in many conditions including autism, anxiety, obesity, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Animal models have been paramount in linking the regulation of fundamental neural processes, such as neurogenesis and myelination, to microbiome activation of microglia. Moreover, translational human studies are ongoing and will greatly enhance the field. Future studies will focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis and attempt to elucidate microbial-based intervention and therapeutic strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders.", "authors": ["John F.

However, visual images captured in dynamic environments or adverse weather conditions often suffer from various degradations. Image restoration focuses on reconstructing clear and sharp images by eliminating undesired degradations from corrupted inputs. These degradations typically vary in size and severity, making it crucial to employ robust multi-scale representation learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Feature Modulation (MSFM), a novel deep convolutional architecture for image restoration. MSFM modulates multi-scale features in both frequency and spatial domains to make features sharper and closer to that of clean images. Specifically, our multi-scale frequency attention module transforms features into multiple scales and then modulates each scale in the implicit frequency domain using pooling and attention. Moreover, we develop a multi-scale spatial modulation module to refine pixels with the guidance of local features. The proposed frequency and spatial modules enable MSFM to better handle degradations of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that MSFM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 datasets for a range of image restoration tasks, i.e., image dehazing, image defocus/motion deblurring, and image desnowing.

A new technique to restore turbulence degraded images is proposed based on imaging with spatial redundancies. Two imaging frameworks that are candidates for implementation of the technique are the plenoptic sensor and the light field camera, which collect multiple depictions of the target through sub-aperture imaging. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of either device in imaging through turbulence. However, as visual distortions vary significantly from weak to strong turbulence conditions, it is unclear when and how a light field approach should be applied to enhance target recognition over distorted media. We present an in-depth study on the fundamental differences between the two devices with regards to turbulence distortion, as well as their image restoration mechanisms. Our analysis combined with proof-of-concept experiments show that the turbulence resilience of light field imaging techniques depends strongly on the mechanism of mapping the light field.

Here we present a global‐scale high‐resolution (0.1°) mapping of sources based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue estimates of dust optical depth in conjunction with other data sets including land use. We ascribe dust sources to natural and anthropogenic (primarily agricultural) origins, calculate their respective contributions to emissions, and extensively compare these products against literature. Natural dust sources globally account for 75% of emissions; anthropogenic sources account for 25%. North Africa accounts for 55% of global dust emissions with only 8% being anthropogenic, mostly from the Sahel. Elsewhere, anthropogenic dust emissions can be much higher (75% in Australia). Hydrologic dust sources (e.g., ephemeral water bodies) account for 31% worldwide; 15% of them are natural while 85% are anthropogenic. Globally, 20% of emissions are from vegetated surfaces, primarily desert shrublands and agricultural lands. Since anthropogenic dust sources are associated with land use and ephemeral water bodies, both in turn linked to the hydrological cycle, their emissions are affected by climate variability. Such changes in dust emissions can impact climate, air quality, and human health. Improved dust emission estimates will require a better mapping of threshold wind velocities, vegetation dynamics, and surface conditions (soil moisture and land use) especially in the sensitive regions identified here, as well as improved ability to address small‐scale convective processes producing dust via cold pool (haboob) events frequent in monsoon regimes.", "authors": ["Paul Ginoux", "Joseph M.

Natural fires have influenced biological evolution and global biogeochemical cycles, making fire integral to the functioning of some biomes. Globally, debate rages about the impact on ecosystems of prehistoric human-set fires, with views ranging from catastrophic to negligible. Understanding of the diversity of human fire regimes on Earth in the past, present and future remains rudimentary. It remains uncertain how humans have caused a departure from 'natural' background levels that vary with climate change. Available evidence shows that modern humans can increase or decrease background levels of natural fire activity by clearing forests, promoting grazing, dispersing plants, altering ignition patterns and actively suppressing fires, thereby causing substantial ecosystem changes and loss of biodiversity. Some of these contemporary fire regimes cause substantial economic disruptions owing to the destruction of infrastructure, degradation of ecosystem services, loss of life, and smoke-related health effects. These episodic disasters help frame negative public attitudes towards landscape fires, despite the need for burning to sustain some ecosystems. Greenhouse gas-induced warming and changes in the hydrological cycle may increase the occurrence of large, severe fires, with potentially significant feedbacks to the Earth system. Improved understanding of human fire regimes demands: (1) better data on past and current human influences on fire regimes to enable global comparative analyses, (2) a greater understanding of different cultural traditions of landscape burning and their positive and negative social, economic and ecological effects, and (3) more realistic representations of anthropogenic fire in global vegetation and climate change models.

They provide various ecological and economical ecosystem services contributing to coastal erosion protection, water filtration, provision of areas for fish and shrimp breeding, provision of building material and medicinal ingredients, and the attraction of tourists, amongst many other factors. At the same time, mangroves belong to the most threatened and vulnerable ecosystems worldwide and experienced a dramatic decline during the last half century. International programs, such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands or the Kyoto Protocol, underscore the importance of immediate protection measures and conservation activities to prevent the further loss of mangroves. In this context, remote sensing is the tool of choice to provide spatio-temporal information on mangrove ecosystem distribution, species differentiation, health status, and ongoing changes of mangrove populations. Such studies can be based on various sensors, ranging from aerial photography to high- and medium-resolution optical imagery and from hyperspectral data to active microwave (SAR) data. Remote-sensing techniques have demonstrated a high potential to detect, identify, map, and monitor mangrove conditions and changes during the last two decades, which is reflected by the large number of scientific papers published on this topic. To our knowledge, a recent review paper on the remote sensing of mangroves does not exist, although mangrove ecosystems have become the focus of attention in the context of current climate change and discussions of the services provided by these ecosystems. Also, climate change-related remote-sensing studies in coastal zones have increased drastically in recent years.

To this end, we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure, and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes associated with human activities. We found that top predators and reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern.

This region has suffered severe environmental degradation (e.g., vegetation cover loss, soil erosion and biodiversity loss). In recent decades, Chinese governments at different levels have initiated several ecological programs (e.g., Green for Grain, Mountain Closure) to restore the degraded environment and to alleviate poverty. Objectives This study summarizes landscape studies of karst landscapes patterns, their dynamics and interactions among landscape pattern, hydrological processes and ecosystem services (ES). Methods We conducted a systematic literature review of science and land use policy to identify knowledge gaps and recommend future research and policy directions. Results Karst landscapes have experienced rapid turnover in recent decades due largely to the overlap of intense human activity on the fragile karst ecosystems. Many studies have comprehensively examined hydrology, soil processes and ecosystem services (ES) and their relationships with landscape pattern. Most of these studies have found that karst ecosystems recover with improved ES. However, the importance of epikarst in hydrological and soil processes, intense anthropogenic disturbance and landscape heterogeneity in landscape models remains elusive. Conclusions Future research should focus on in-depth examination and modelling of karst specific hydrological and soil processes, investigating relationships between climatic change, landscape change, ecological processes, and region-specific ES assessments.

Here, we developed an iterative reconstruction method for undersampled radial MRI which (i) is based on a nonlinear optimization, (ii) allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge with use of penalty functions, and (iii) deals with data from multiple coils. The procedure arises as a two-step mechanism which first estimates the coil profiles and then renders a final image that complies with the actual observations. Prior knowledge is introduced by penalizing edges in coil profiles and by a total variation constraint for the final image. The latter condition leads to an effective suppression of undersampling (streaking) artifacts and further adds a certain degree of denoising.

Note that the estimate of natural terrestrial biological fixation (58 TgN yr−1) is lower than former estimates (100 TgN yr−1, Galloway et al., 2004), but the ranges overlap, 50 to 100 TgN yr−1 vs. 90 to 120 TgN yr−1, respectively). Of this created reactive nitrogen, NOx and NH3 emissions from anthropogenic sources are about fourfold greater than natural emissions (Table 6.9, Section 1b). A greater portion of the NH3 emissions is deposited to the continents rather than to the oceans, relative to the deposition of NOy, due to the longer atmospheric residence time of the latter. These deposition estimates are lower limits, as they do not include organic nitrogen species. New model and measurement information (Kanakidou et al., 2012) suggests that incomplete inclusion of emissions and atmospheric chemistry of reduced and oxidized organic nitrogen components in current models may lead to systematic underestimates of total global reactive nitrogen deposition by up to 35% (Table 6.9, Section 1c).

Most reports come from western and northern Europe, where the insect fauna is well-studied and there are considerable demographic data for many taxonomically disparate lineages. Additional cases of faunal losses have been noted from Asia, North America, the Arctic, the Neotropics, and elsewhere. While this review addresses both species loss and population declines, its emphasis is on the latter. Declines of abundant species can be especially worrisome, given that they anchor trophic interactions and shoulder many of the essential ecosystem services of their respective communities. A review of the factors believed to be responsible for observed collapses and those perceived to be especially threatening to insects form the core of this treatment. In addition to widely recognized threats to insect biodiversity, e.g., habitat destruction, agricultural intensification (including pesticide use), climate change, and invasive species, this assessment highlights a few less commonly considered factors such as atmospheric nitrification from the burning of fossil fuels and the effects of droughts and changing precipitation patterns. Because the geographic extent and magnitude of insect declines are largely unknown, there is an urgent need for monitoring efforts, especially across ecological gradients, which will help to identify important causal factors in declines. This review also considers the status of vertebrate insectivores, reporting bias, challenges inherent in collecting and interpreting insect demographic data, and cases of increasing insect abundance.", "authors": ["David L.

We aim to integrate the advantages of the physical model and the generative network. Furthermore, we hope to supplement and even deduce the information missing in the low-light image through the generative network. Therefore, Diff-Retinex formulates the lowlight image enhancement problem into Retinex decomposition and conditional image generation. In the Retinex decomposition, we integrate the superiority of attention in Transformer and meticulously design a Retinex Transformer decomposition network (TDN) to decompose the image into illumination and reflectance maps. Then, we design multi-path generative diffusion networks to reconstruct the normal-light Retinex probability distribution and solve the various degradations in these components respectively, including dark illumination, noise, color deviation, loss of scene contents, etc. Owing to generative diffusion model, Diff-Retinex puts the restoration of low-light subtle detail into practice. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world low-light datasets qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness, superiority, and generalization of the proposed method.", "authors": ["Xunpeng Yi", "Han Xu", "Hao Zhang", "Linfeng Tang", "Jiayi Ma"], "year": 2023, "venue": "", "cited_by_count": 187, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Color constancy", "Artificial intelligence", "Generative model", "Computer science", "Computer vision"], "search_query": "diffusion model image restoration generation"}

This dual diffusion framework expands the denoising-based diffusion models, initially uninterpretable for image restoration, into a unified and interpretable model for both image generation and restoration by introducing residuals. Specifically, our residual diffusion represents directional diffusion from the target image to the degraded input image and explicitly guides the reverse generation process for image restoration, while noise diffusion represents random perturbations in the diffusion process. The residual prioritizes certainty, while the noise emphasizes diversity, enabling RDDM to effectively unify tasks with varying certainty or diversity requirements, such as image generation and restoration. We demonstrate that our sampling process is consistent with that of DDPM and DDIM through coefficient transformation, and propose a partially path-independent generation process to better understand the reverse process. Notably, our RDDM enables a generic UNet, trained with only an L1 loss and a batch size of 1, to compete with state-of-the-art image restoration methods. We provide code and pre-trained models to encourage further exploration, application, and development of our innovative framework (https://github.com/nachifurlRDDM).", "authors": ["Jiawei Liu", "Qiang Wang", "Huijie Fan", "Yinong Wang", "Yandong Tang", "Liangqiong Qu"], "year": 2024, "venue": "", "cited_by_count": 77, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Residual", "Diffusion", "Noise reduction", "Computer science", "Artificial intelligence"], "search_query": "diffusion model image restoration generation"}

Therefore, we present ResDiff, a novel Diffusion Probabilistic Model based on Residual structure for Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). ResDiff utilizes a combination of a CNN, which restores primary low-frequency components, and a DPM, which predicts the residual between the ground-truth image and the CNN predicted image. In contrast to the common diffusion-based methods that directly use LR space to guide the noise towards HR space, ResDiff utilizes the CNN’s initial prediction to direct the noise towards the residual space between HR space and CNN-predicted space, which not only accelerates the generation process but also acquires superior sample quality. Additionally, a frequency-domain-based loss function for CNN is introduced to facilitate its restoration, and a frequency-domain guided diffusion is designed for DPM on behalf of predicting high-frequency details. The extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ResDiff outperforms previous diffusion based methods in terms of shorter model convergence time, superior generation quality, and more diverse samples.", "authors": ["Shuyao Shang", "Zhengyang Shan", "Guangxing Liu", "Lunqian Wang", "Xinghua Wang", "Zekai Zhang", "Jinglin Zhang"], "year": 2024, "venue": "Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "cited_by_count": 104, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Image (mathematics)", "Diffusion", "Superresolution", "Computer science", "Resolution (logic)"], "search_query": "diffusion model image restoration generation"}

However, their restored images still suffer from unsatisfactory boundary artifacts, due to the lack of degradation prior embedding and the deficiency in modeling capacity. Our work addresses these issues by proposing a unified diffusion framework that integrates both the image and degradation priors for highly effective shadow removal. In detail, we first propose a shadow degradation model, which inspires us to build a novel unrolling diffusion model, dubbed ShandowDiffusion. It remarkably improves the model's capacity in shadow removal via progressively refining the desired output with both degradation prior and diffusive generative prior, which by nature can serve as a new strong baseline for image restoration. Furthermore, ShadowDiffusion progressively refines the estimated shadow mask as an auxiliary task of the diffusion generator, which leads to more accurate and robust shadow-free image generation. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular public datasets, including ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD, to validate our method's effectiveness. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our model achieves a significant improvement in terms of PSNR, increasing from 31.69dB to 34. 73dB over SRD dataset. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> https://github.com/GuoLanqing/ShadowDiffusion", "authors": ["Lanqing Guo", "Chong Wang", "Wenhan Yang", "Siyu Huang", "Yufei Wang", "Hanspeter Pfister", "Bihan Wen"], "year": 2023, "venue": "", "cited_by_count": 108, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Shadow (psychology)", "Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Degradation (telecommunications)", "Image (mathematics)"], "search_query": "diffusion model image restoration generation"}

Currently, diffusion models employ robust image generation capabilities for enhancing low-light images. However, diffusion models require multiple iterations at the image feature level to generate details and content, which limits the speed. Moreover, the diffusion-based methods tend to generate unexpected artifacts in the degraded regions. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency Priors-guided Image Enhancement (FPIE) network, including a frequency prior generation network and an image restoration network. FPIE significantly accelerates inference by learning abstract prior with frequency domain constraints. Concretely, to learn compacted priors at the frequency domain, we introduce a joint training approach for the prior generation and restoration models to constrain the distribution of priors. Furthermore, to better utilize frequency-domain features for enhancing the network’s generation capabilities, a wavelet-based transformer block is introduced to produce intricate details and avoid the artifacts of the output.

Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, \"whether diffusion model can boost image restoration\". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting.

In particular, the pre-trained text-to-image stable diffusion models provide a potential solution to the challenging realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) and image stylization problems with their strong generative priors. However, the existing methods along this line often fail to keep faithful pixel-wise image structures. If extra skip connections between the encoder and the decoder of a VAE are used to reproduce details, additional training in image space will be required, limiting the application to tasks in latent space such as image stylization. In this work, we propose a pixel-aware stable diffusion (PASD) network to achieve robust Real-ISR and personalized image stylization. Specifically, a pixel-aware cross attention module is introduced to enable diffusion models perceiving image local structures in pixel-wise level, while a degradation removal module is used to extract degradation insensitive features to guide the diffusion process together with image high level information. An adjustable noise schedule is introduced to further improve the image restoration results. By simply replacing the base diffusion model with a stylized one, PASD can generate diverse stylized images without collecting pairwise training data, and by shifting the base model with an aesthetic one, PASD can bring old photos back to life. Extensive experiments in a variety of image enhancement and stylization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PASD approach.

Our main approach integrates the diffusion model with Retinex-driven restoration to achieve physically-inspired generative enhancement, making it a pioneering effort. To be detailed, Diff-Retinex++ consists of two-stage view modules, including the Denoising Diffusion Model (DDM), and the Retinex-Driven Mixture of Experts Model (RMoE). First, DDM treats low-light image enhancement as one type of image generation task, benefiting from the powerful generation ability of diffusion model to handle the enhancement. Second, we design the Retinex theory into the plug-and-play supervision attention module. It leverages the latent features in the backbone and knowledge distillation to learn Retinex rules, and further regulates these latent features through the attention mechanism. In this way, it couples the relationship between Retinex decomposition and image enhancement in a new view, achieving dual improvement. In addition, the Low-Light Mixture of Experts preserves the vividness of the diffusion model and fidelity of the Retinex-driven restoration to the greatest extent.

Most of the advanced face restoration models can recover high-quality faces from low-quality ones but usually fail to faithfully generate realistic and high-frequency details that are favored by users. To achieve authentic restoration, we propose IDM, an Iteratively learned face restoration system based on denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs). We define the criterion of an authentic face restoration system, and argue that denoising diffusion models are naturally endowed with this property from two aspects: intrinsic iterative refinement and extrinsic iterative enhancement. Intrinsic learning can preserve the content well and gradually refine the high-quality details, while extrinsic enhancement helps clean the data and improve the restoration task one step further. We demonstrate superior performance on blind face restoration tasks. Beyond restoration, we find the authentically cleaned data by the proposed restoration system is also helpful to image generation tasks in terms of training stabilization and sample quality.

This type of method only needs to use the pre-trained off-the-shelf diffusion models, without any finetuning, and can directly handle various IR tasks. The upper limit of the restoration performance depends on the pre-trained diffusion models, which are in rapid evolution. However, current methods only discuss how to deal with fixed-size images, but dealing with images of arbitrary sizes is very important for practical applications. This paper focuses on how to use those diffusion-based zero-shot IR methods to deal with any size while maintaining the excellent characteristics of zero-shot. A simple way to solve arbitrary size is to divide it into fixed-size patches and solve each patch independently. But this may yield significant artifacts since it neither considers the global semantics ofall patches nor the local information of adjacent patches. Inspired by the Range-Null space Decomposition, we propose the Mask-Shift Restoration to address local incoherence and propose the Hierarchical Restoration to alleviate out-of-domain issues.

NIR interacts with cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (COX) to transiently reduce COX activity, attenuate mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization, and thus reduce ROS production. We evaluated a specific combination of COX-inhibitory NIR (750 nm and 950 nm) in a rat stroke model with longitudinal analysis of brain injury using magnetic resonance imaging.

En-suring both text fidelity and style realness is crucial for high-quality text image super-resolution. Recently, diffusion models have achieved great success in natural image synthesis and restoration due to their powerful data distribution modeling abilities and data generation capabili-ties. In this work, we propose an Image Diffusion Model (IDM) to restore text images with realistic styles. For diffusion models, they are not only suitable for modeling realis-tic image distribution but also appropriate for learning text distribution. Since text prior is important to guarantee the correctness of the restored text structure according to existing arts, we also propose a Text Diffusion Model (TDM) for text recognition which can guide IDM to generate text images with correct structures. We further propose a Mixture of Multi-modality module (MoM) to make these two diffusion models cooperate with each other in all the diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our Diffusion-based Blind Text Image Super-Resolution (DiffTSR) can restore text images with more accurate text structures as well as more realistic appearances simultaneously.

Typically, diffusion models trained in specific datasets fail to recover images that have out-of-distribution degradations. To address this problem, this work leverages a capable vision-language model and a synthetic degradation pipeline to learn image restoration in the wild (wild IR). More specifically, all low-quality images are simulated with a synthetic degradation pipeline that contains multiple common degradations such as blur, resize, noise, and JPEG compression. Then we introduce robust training for a degradation-aware CLIP model to extract enriched image content features to assist high-quality image restoration. Our base diffusion model is the image restoration SDE (IR-SDE). Built upon it, we further present a posterior sampling strategy for fast noise-free image generation. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets. Moreover, experiments on the unified image restoration task illustrate that the proposed posterior sampling improves image generation quality for various degradations.", "authors": ["Ziwei Luo", "Fredrik Gustafsson", "Zheng Zhao", "Jens Sjölund", "Thomas B.

We propose an elegant modification of the forward stochastic differential equation of diffusion models to adapt them to this restoration task and name our method DriftRec. Comparing DriftRec against an L<sub>2</sub> regression baseline with the same network architecture and state-of-the-art techniques for JPEG restoration, we show that our approach can escape the tendency of other methods to generate blurry images, and recovers the distribution of clean images significantly more faithfully. For this, only a dataset of clean/corrupted image pairs and no knowledge about the corruption operation is required, enabling wider applicability to other restoration tasks. In contrast to other conditional and unconditional diffusion models, we utilize the idea that the distributions of clean and corrupted images are much closer to each other than each is to the usual Gaussian prior of the reverse process in diffusion models. Our approach therefore requires only low levels of added noise and needs comparatively few sampling steps even without further optimizations. We show that DriftRec naturally generalizes to realistic and difficult scenarios such as unaligned double JPEG compression and blind restoration of JPEGs found online, without having encountered such examples during training.", "authors": ["Simon Welker", "Henry N.

However, in the previous diffusion model based LIE methods, the conditions used for guiding generation are degraded images, such as low-light image, signal-to-noise ratio map and color map, which suffer from severe degradation and are simply fed into diffusion model by rigidly concatenating with the noise. To avoid using degraded conditions resulting in sub-optimal performance in recovering details and enhancing brightness, we use the image intrinsic components originating from the Retinex model as guidance, whose multi-scale features are flexibly integrated into the diffusion model, and propose a novel conditional diffusion model for LIE. Specifically, the input low-light image is decomposed into reflectance and illumination by a Retinex decomposition module, where two components contain abundant physical property and lighting conditions of the scene. Then, we extract the latent features from two conditions through a component-dependent feature extraction module, which is designed according to the physical property of components. Finally, instead of previous rigid concatenation manner, a well-designed feature fusion mechanism is equipped to adaptively embed generative conditions into diffusion model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and is capable of effectively restoring the local details while brightening the dark regions.

We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space, we can then leverage the sampling strat-egy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration, where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space. This approach allows us to produce results that accurately preserve high-frequency details, which previous works are unable to do.
