However, artifacts often inevitably appear in the generated results, leading to downgraded user experience and reduced performance in downstream tasks. This work aims to develop a plugin post-processing module for diverse generative models, which can faithfully restore images from diverse generative artifacts. This is challenging because: (1) Unlike traditional degradation patterns, generative artifacts are non-linear and the transformation function is highly complex. (2) There are no readily available artifact-image pairs. (3) Different from model-specific anti-artifact methods, a model-agnostic framework views the generator as a black-box machine and has no access to the architecture details. In this work, we first design a group of mechanisms to simulate generative artifacts of popular generators (i.e., GANs, autoregressive models, and diffusion models), given real images. Second, we implement the model-agnostic anti-artifact framework as an image-to-image diffusion model, due to its advantage in generation quality and capacity. Finally, we design a conditioning scheme for the diffusion model to enable both blind and non-blind image restoration. A guidance parameter is also introduced to allow for a trade-off between restoration accuracy and image quality.

However, several attempts have been made to adopt diffusion models to noisy inverse problems either fail to achieve satisfactory results or require a few thousand iterations to achieve high-quality reconstructions. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based image restoration with error contraction and error correction (DiffECC) method. Two strategies are introduced to contract the restoration error in the posterior sampling process. First, we combine existing CNN-based approaches with diffusion models to ensure data consistency from the beginning. Second, to amplify the error contraction effects of the noise, a restart sampling algorithm is designed. In the error correction strategy, the estimation-correction idea is proposed on both the data term and the prior term. Solving them iteratively within the diffusion sampling framework leads to superior image generation results.

Existing methods such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or continuous diffusion models present their own issues including GANs being difficult to train while continuous diffusion models requiring numerous inference steps. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Token Evaluation and Refinement (ITER) framework for RWSR, which utilizes a discrete diffusion model operating in the discrete token representation space, i.e., indexes of features extracted from a VQGAN codebook pre-trained with high-quality (HQ) images. We show that ITER is easier to train than GANs and more efficient than continuous diffusion models. Specifically, we divide RWSR into two sub-tasks, i.e., distortion removal and texture generation. Distortion removal involves simple HQ token prediction with LQ images, while texture generation uses a discrete diffusion model to iteratively refine the distortion removal output with a token refinement network. In particular, we propose to include a token evaluation network in the discrete diffusion process. It learns to evaluate which tokens are good restorations and helps to improve the iterative refinement results. Moreover, the evaluation network can first check status of the distortion removal output and then adaptively select total refinement steps needed, thereby maintaining a good balance between distortion removal and texture generation.

To address challenges such as incomplete stripe removal, potential loss of image details and textures, and the generation of artificial artifacts during destriping, we propose a novel stripe removal method based on a knowledge-embedded diffusion model (KEDM). This approach effectively integrates the spatial distribution characteristics of stripe noise with an innovative, data-driven diffusion network model, creating a hybrid knowledge and data-driven framework for stripe correction. The core components of KEDM are the latent diffusion model (LDM) architecture and the directional wavelet convolution module (DWCM). Specifically, LDM leverages a pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE) to transform the input image into latent feature space for efficient diffusion propagation, reducing computational complexity while preserving image restoration quality. Meanwhile, DWCM uses wavelet convolution operations to construct prior loss functions for stripe noise, precisely guiding the diffusion reconstruction process to achieve a clean, stripe-free image.

Progress includes a better appreciation of gravity wave sources and characteristics, the evolution of the gravity wave spectrum with altitude and with variations of wind and stability, the character and implications of observed climatologies, and the wave interaction and instability processes that constrain wave amplitudes and spectral shape. Recent studies have also expanded dramatically our understanding of gravity wave influences on the large‐scale circulation and the thermal and constituent structures of the middle atmosphere. These advances have led to a number of parameterizations of gravity wave effects which are enabling ever more realistic descriptions of gravity wave forcing in large‐scale models.

Some studies have further explored the use of LLMs for planning and invoking models or APIs to address more general multi-modal user queries. Despite this progress, complex visual-based tasks still remain challenging due to the diverse nature of visual tasks. This diversity is reflected in two aspects: 1) Reasoning paths. For many real-life applications, it is hard to accurately decompose a query simply by examining the query itself. Planning based on the specific visual content and the results of each step is usually required. 2) Flexible inputs and intermediate results. Input forms could be flexible for in-the-wild cases, and involves not only a single image or video but a mixture of videos and images, e.g., a user-view image with some reference videos. Besides, a complex reasoning process will also generate diverse multimodal intermediate results, e.g., video narrations, segmented video clips, etc. To address such general cases, we propose a multi-modal AI assistant, AssistGPT, with an interleaved code and language reasoning approach called Plan, Execute, Inspect, and Learn (PEIL) to integrate LLMs with various tools. Specifically, the Planner is capable of using natural language to plan which tool in Executor should do next based on the current reasoning progress. Inspector is an efficient memory manager to assist the Planner to feed proper visual information into a specific tool.

ChatGPT-4 Vision significantly outperformed the average exam participant, positioning itself within the top 10 best score percentile.

This study explores the ability of MLLMs in visually solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) using images that portray point distributions on a two-dimensional plane. We introduce a novel approach employing multiple specialized agents within the MLLM framework, each dedicated to optimizing solutions for these combinatorial challenges. We benchmarked our multi-agent model solutions against the Google OR tools, which served as the baseline for comparison. The results demonstrated that both multi-agent models—Multi-Agent 1, which includes the initializer, critic, and scorer agents, and Multi-Agent 2, which comprises only the initializer and critic agents—significantly improved the solution quality for TSP and mTSP problems. Multi-Agent 1 excelled in environments requiring detailed route refinement and evaluation, providing a robust framework for sophisticated optimizations. In contrast, Multi-Agent 2, focusing on iterative refinements by the initializer and critic, proved effective for rapid decision-making scenarios. These experiments yield promising outcomes, showcasing the robust visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in addressing diverse combinatorial problems. The findings underscore the potential of MLLMs as powerful tools in computational optimization, offering insights that could inspire further advancements in this promising field.", "authors": ["Mohammed Elhenawy", "Ahmad Abutahoun", "Taqwa I.

This study evaluates the performance of two large multimodal model-based chatbots, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o, on the brief electricity and magnetism assessment (BEMA), a conceptual physics inventory rich in visual representations such as vector fields, circuit diagrams, and graphs. Quantitative analysis shows that ChatGPT-4o outperforms both ChatGPT-4 and a large sample of university students, and demonstrates improvements in ChatGPT-4o’s vision interpretation ability over its predecessor ChatGPT-4. However, qualitative analysis of ChatGPT-4o’s responses reveals persistent challenges. We identified three types of difficulties in the chatbot’s responses to tasks on BEMA: (i) difficulties with visual interpretation, (ii) difficulties in providing correct physics laws or rules, and (iii) difficulties with spatial coordination and application of physics representations. Spatial reasoning tasks, particularly those requiring the use of the right-hand rule, proved especially problematic. These findings highlight that the most broadly used large multimodal model-based chatbot, ChatGPT-4o, still exhibits significant difficulties in engaging with physics tasks involving visual representations. While the chatbot shows potential for educational applications, including personalized tutoring and accessibility support for students who are blind or have low vision, its limitations necessitate caution. On the other hand, our findings can also be leveraged to design assessments that are difficult for chatbots to solve.", "authors": ["Giulia Polverini", "J.-B.

Training-induced structural brain changes have been demonstrated in the healthy adult human brain. However, no study has yet directly related structural brain changes to behavioral changes in the developing brain, addressing the question of whether structural brain differences seen in adults (comparing experts with matched controls) are a product of \"nature\" (via biological brain predispositions) or \"nurture\" (via early training). Long-term instrumental music training is an intense, multisensory, and motor experience and offers an ideal opportunity to study structural brain plasticity in the developing brain in correlation with behavioral changes induced by training. Here we demonstrate structural brain changes after only 15 months of musical training in early childhood, which were correlated with improvements in musically relevant motor and auditory skills. These findings shed light on brain plasticity and suggest that structural brain differences in adult experts (whether musicians or experts in other areas) are likely due to training-induced brain plasticity.", "authors": ["Krista L.

In this survey, we consider how the Data Augmentation training strategy can aid in its development. We begin with the major motifs of Data Augmentation summarized into strengthening local decision boundaries, brute force training, causality and counterfactual examples, and the distinction between meaning and form. We follow these motifs with a concrete list of augmentation frameworks that have been developed for text data. Deep Learning generally struggles with the measurement of generalization and characterization of overfitting. We highlight studies that cover how augmentations can construct test sets for generalization. NLP is at an early stage in applying Data Augmentation compared to Computer Vision. We highlight the key differences and promising ideas that have yet to be tested in NLP. For the sake of practical implementation, we describe tools that facilitate Data Augmentation such as the use of consistency regularization, controllers, and offline and online augmentation pipelines, to preview a few. Finally, we discuss interesting topics around Data Augmentation in NLP such as task-specific augmentations, the use of prior knowledge in self-supervised learning versus Data Augmentation, intersections with transfer and multi-task learning, and ideas for AI-GAs (AI-Generating Algorithms).

Cross-cultural skills play a significant role in language learning. Previous research has discovered that including cross-cultural aspects in language teaching contributes to enhancing self-identity, citizenship, and respect for diverse lifestyles. Besides, it has been demonstrated that cultural traits that underlie the English language are associated to the way in which individuals construct meaning, but little attention has been given to the effects of semiotic elements in cross-cultural exposure specifically, through the use of multimodal literacies in contrasting tasks. The present qualitative action research study used questionnaires, journals, artifacts, and reflective logs to collect data for determining the effects of implementing multimodal literacies to enhance cross-cultural awareness in students with A1 level of proficiency according to the CEFR. Data were analyzed using the grounded theory, and it demonstrated that the students gained significant awareness of cultural patterns that are embedded in communicative interactions so that they made connections between foreign and own identities.

This study assesses the capabilities of a multimodal advanced LLM, GPT-4o, in understanding and suggesting cartographic design elements, focusing on adherence to established cartographic principles. Two assessments were conducted: a text-to-text evaluation and an image-to-text evaluation. In the text-to-text assessment, GPT-4o was presented with 15 queries derived from key concepts in cartography, covering classification, symbolization, visual hierarchy, color theory, and typography. Each query was posed multiple times under different temperature settings to evaluate consistency and variability. In the image-to-text evaluation, GPT-4o analyzed maps containing deliberate cartographic errors to assess its ability to identify issues and suggest improvements. The results indicate that GPT-4o demonstrates general reliability in text-based tasks, with variability influenced by temperature settings. The model showed proficiency in classification and symbolization tasks but occasionally deviated from theoretical expectations. In visual hierarchy and layout, the model performed consistently, suggesting appropriate design choices. In the image-to-text assessment, GPT-4o effectively identified critical design flaws such as inappropriate color schemes, poor contrast and misuse of shape and size variables, offering actionable suggestions for improvement. However, limitations include dependency on input quality and challenges in interpreting nuanced spatial relationships. The study concludes that LLMs like GPT-4o have significant potential in cartographic design, particularly for tasks involving creative exploration and routine design support. Their ability to critique and generate cartographic elements positions them as valuable tools for enhancing human expertise.

Curiously, this knowledge had had a limited impact on the field of instructional design with most instructional design recommendations proceeding as though working memory and long-term memory did not exist. In contrast, cognitive load theory emphasised that all novel information first is processed by a capacity and duration limited working memory and then stored in an unlimited long-term memory for later use. Once information is stored in long-term memory, the capacity and duration limits of working memory disappear transforming our ability to function.

This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT’s output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a continuous implicit attention-in-attention network, called CiaoSR.

In this work,we propose a novel method called Meta-SR to firstly solve super-resolution of arbitrary scale factor (including non-integer scale factors) with a single model. In our Meta-SR,the Meta-Upscale Module is proposed to replace the traditional upscale module. For arbitrary scale factor, the Meta-Upscale Module dynamically predicts the weights of the up-scale filters by taking the scale factor as input and use these weights to generate the HR image of arbitrary size.

To address this issue, we propose the Continuous Optical Zooming dataset (COZ), by constructing an automatic imaging system to collect images at fine-grained various focal lengths within a specific range and providing strict image pair alignment. The COZ dataset serves as a benchmark to provide real-world data for training and testing arbitrary-scale SR models.

The existing scale-arbitrary super-resolution methods are primarily predicated on learning either a discrete representation (DR) or a continuous representation (CR) of the image, with DR retaining the sensitivity to resolution and CR guaranteeing the generalization of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel image representation that combines the discrete and continuous representation, known as CDCR, which enables the extension of images to any desired resolution in a plug-and-play manner. CDCR consists of two components: a CR-based dense prediction that gathers more available information and a DR-based resolution-specific refinement that adjusts the predicted values of local pixels. Furthermore, we introduce a scale cumulative ascent (SCA) method, which enhances the performance of the dense prediction and improves the accuracy of the generated images at ultra-high magnifications.

From the perspective of approximation theory, SRNO first embeds the LR input into a higher-dimensional latent representation space, trying to capture sufficient basis functions, and then iteratively approximates the implicit image function with a kernel integral mechanism, followed by a final dimensionality reduction step to generate the RGB representation at the target coordinates. The key characteristics distinguishing SRNO from prior continuous SR works are: 1) the kernel integral in each layer is efficiently implemented via the Galerkin-type attention, which possesses non-local properties in the spatial domain and therefore benefits the grid-free continuum; and 2) the multilayer attention architecture allows for the dynamic latent basis update, which is crucial for SR problems to “hallucinate” high-frequency information from the LR image.

However, image SR methods mostly designed for natural images do not generalize well for SCIs due to the very different image characteristics as well as the requirement of SCI browsing at arbitrary scales.

Most existing methods, however, generate images only at fixed-scale magnification and suffer from over-smoothing and artifacts. Additionally, they do not offer enough diversity of output images nor image consistency at different scales. Most relevant work applied Implicit Neural Representation (INR) to the denoising diffusion model to obtain continuous-resolution yet diverse and high-quality SR results. Since this model operates in the image space, the larger the resolution of image is produced, the more memory and inference time is required, and it also does not maintain scale-specific consistency. We propose a novel pipeline that can super-resolve an input image or generate from a random noise a novel image at arbitrary scales. The method consists of a pre-trained auto-encoder, a latent diffusion model, and an implicit neural decoder, and their learning strategies. The proposed method adopts diffusion processes in a latent space, thus efficient, yet aligned with output image space decoded by MLPs at arbitrary scales. More specifically, our arbitrary-scale decoder is designed by the symmetric decoder w/o up-scaling from the pre-trained auto-encoder, and Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF) in series. The latent diffusion process is learnt by the denoising and the alignment losses jointly. Errors in output images are backpropagated via the fixed decoder, improving the quality of output images.

To do this, we represent an image as a decoding function that maps locations in the image along with their associated features to their reciprocal pixel attributes. Since the pixel locations are continuous in this representation, our method can refer to any location in an image of varying resolution. To retrieve an image of a particular resolution, we apply a decoding function to a grid of locations each of which refers to the center of a pixel in the output image. In contrast to other techniques, our dual interactive neural network decouples content and positional features. As a result, we obtain a fully implicit representation of the image that solves the super-resolution problem at (real-valued) elective scales using a single model. We demonstrate the efficacy and flexibility of our approach against the state of the art on publicly available benchmark datasets.", "authors": ["Quan Nguyen", "William J.

By contrast, color-guided depth map super-resolution is less explored based on implicit function learning. The related research faces three questions. First, is it also necessary and applicable to fuse the depth feature and the color feature in the encoder with continuous upsampling scales? Second, is the scale information in the encoder as important as that in the decoder? Third, how to efficiently and effectively model the affinity of location distance and content similarity within cross domains in the decoder? This paper proposes a transformer-based network to answer the above questions, which includes a depth super-resolution branch and a guidance extraction branch. Specifically, in the encoder, the effective implicit cross transformer is designed to fuse the guidance from the color feature with continuous coordinate mapping. In addition, the unrelated guidance is filtered out by correlation evaluation in the high-dimension feature space. Unlike the scale only introduced in the decoder, this paper additionally embeds the scale into the position encoding and the feed-forward network in the encoder to learn the scale-aware feature representation. In the decoder, the high-resolution depth feature is reconstructed by using the internal prior and the external guidance. The internal prior is implemented by implicit self-attention in the depth super-resolution branch, and the external guidance is exploited via implicit cross-attention between both branches. Finally, the above decoded features are complementary to generate the high-resolution depth map. The sufficient experiments on the synthetic and real datasets for in-distribution and out-of-distribution upsampling scales validate the improved performance.

However, in practical applications, it is important to continuously super-resolve RSIs to multiple resolutions, as different resolutions present various levels of detail. Retraining the model for each scale factor consumes huge computational resources and storage space. Existing continuous-scale SR models employ static convolutions, and most are designed for natural scenes, ignoring dynamic feature extraction needs for different scale factors and the inherent properties of RSIs. In addition, efficiently obtaining the continuous representation of RSIs and avoiding the artifacts of RSI SR results is still a challenging problem. To address the above problems, we propose a scale-aware dynamic network (SADN) for RSI continuous-scale SR. First, we devise a scale-aware dynamic convolutional (SAD-Conv) layer to handle the strong randomness of the RSI textural distribution and achieve dynamic feature extraction according to scale factors. Second, we devise a continuous-scale upsampling module (CSUM) with the multi-bilinear global implicit function (MBGIF) for any-scale upsampling. The CSUM constructs multiple feature spaces with asymptotic resolutions to approximate the continuous representation of an image, and then, the MBGIF makes full use of multiresolution features to map arbitrary coordinates to spectral values. We evaluate our SADN using various benchmarks, and the experimental results show that the CSUM can efficiently achieve continuous-scale upsampling while maintaining excellent objective and visual performance. Moreover, our SADN uses fewer parameters and even outperforms the state-of-the-art fixed-scale SR methods.

Most previous studies only consider several integer magnification factors and focus on obtaining a specific SR model for each scale factor. However, in the real world, it is a common requirement to zoom the videos arbitrarily by rolling the mouse wheel. In this article, we propose a unified network for arbitrary scale SR (ASSR) of video satellite images. The proposed ASSR consists of two modules, i.e., feature learning module and arbitrary upscale module. The feature learning module accepts multiple low-resolution (LR) frames and extracts useful features of those frames by using many 3-D residual blocks. The arbitrary upscale module takes the extracted features as input and enhances the spatial resolution by subpixel convolution and bicubic-based adjustment. Different from existing video satellite image SR methods, ASSR can continuously zoom LR video satellite images with arbitrary integer and noninteger scale factors in a single model. Experiments have been conducted on real video satellite images acquired by Jilin-1 and OVS-1.

Instead of representing images discretely with 2D arrays of pixels, a recent study, namely local implicit image function (LIIF), denotes images as a continuous function where pixel values are expansion by using the corresponding coordinates as inputs. Due to its continuous nature, LIIF can be adopted for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution tasks, resulting in a single effective and efficient model for various up-scaling factors. However, LIIF often suffers from structural distortions and ringing artifacts around edges, mostly because all pixels share the same model, thus ignoring the local properties of the image. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive local image function (A-LIIF) to alleviate this problem. Specifically, our A-LIIF consists of two main components: an encoder and a expansion network. The former captures cross-scale image features, while the latter models the continuous up-scaling function by a weighted combination of multiple local implicit image functions. Accordingly, our A-LIIF can reconstruct the high-frequency textures and structures more accurately. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method.

Existing super-resolution (SR) networks commonly employ static convolutions during feature extraction, which cannot effectively perceive changes in scales. Moreover, these continuous-scale upsampling modules only utilize the scale factors, without considering the diversity of local features. To activate more information for better reconstruction, two plug-in and compatible modules for fixed-scale networks are designed to perform arbitrary-scale SR tasks. Firstly, we design a Scale-aware Local Feature Adaptation Module (SLFAM), which adaptively adjusts the attention weights of dynamic filters based on the local features and scales. It enables the network to possess stronger representation capabilities. Then we propose a Local Feature Adaptation Upsampling Module (LFAUM), which combines scales and local features to perform arbitrary-scale reconstruction. It allows the upsampling to adapt to local structures. Besides, deformable convolution is utilized letting more information to be activated in the reconstruction, enabling the network to better adapt to the texture features.

However, these continuous image representations typically implement decoding in High-Resolution (HR) High-Dimensional (HD) space, leading to a quadratic increase in computational cost and seriously hindering the practical applications of ASSR. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Latent Modulated Function (LMF), which decouples the HR-HD decoding process into shared latent decoding in LR-HD space and independent rendering in HR Low-Dimensional (LD) space, thereby realizing the first computational optimal paradigm of continuous image representation. Specifically, LMF utilizes an HD MLP in latent space to generate latent modulations of each LR feature vector. This enables a modulated LD MLP in render space to quickly adapt to any input feature vector and perform rendering at arbitrary resolution. Further-more, we leverage the positive correlation between modulation intensity and input image complexity to design a Controllable Multi-Scale Rendering (CMSR) algorithm, offering the flexibility to adjust the decoding efficiency based on the rendering precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that converting existing INR-based ASSR methods to LMF can reduce the computational cost by up to 99.9%, accelerate inference by up to 57×, and save up to 76% of parameters, while maintaining competitive performance.

Most existing INR-based ASSR networks first extract features from the given low-resolution image using an encoder, and then render the super-resolved result via a multi-layer perceptron decoder. Although these approaches have shown promising results, their performance is constrained by the limited representation ability of discrete latent codes in the encoded features. In this paper, we propose a novel ASSR method named GaussianSR that overcomes this limitation through 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). Unlike traditional methods that treat pixels as discrete points, GaussianSR represents each pixel as a continuous Gaussian field. The encoded features are simultaneously refined and upsampled by rendering the mutually stacked Gaussian fields. As a result, long-range dependencies are established to enhance representation ability. In addition, a classifier is developed to dynamically assign Gaussian kernels to all pixels to further improve flexibility.

As compared with earlier single-moment BMPs, the new scheme incorporates a large number of improvements to both physical processes and computer coding, and it employs many techniques found in far more sophisticated spectral/bin schemes using lookup tables. Unlike any other BMP, the assumed snow size distribution depends on both ice water content and temperature and is represented as a sum of exponential and gamma distributions. Furthermore, snow assumes a nonspherical shape with a bulk density that varies inversely with diameter as found in observations and in contrast to nearly all other BMPs that assume spherical snow with constant density. The new scheme’s snow category was readily modified to match previous research in sensitivity experiments designed to test the sphericity and distribution shape characteristics. From analysis of four idealized sensitivity experiments, it was determined that the sphericity and constant density assumptions play a major role in producing supercooled liquid water whereas the assumed distribution shape plays a lesser, but nonnegligible, role. Further testing using numerous case studies and comparing model results with in situ and other observations confirmed the results of the idealized experiments and are briefly mentioned herein, but more detailed, microphysical comparisons with observations are found in a companion paper in this series (Part III, forthcoming).", "authors": ["Gregory Thompson", "Paul R.

In zero magnetic field there are two crossovers upon approaching ${\\mathit{T}}_{\\mathit{c}}$, first the ``Ginzburg'' crossover from mean-field behavior to the universality class of an uncharged superfluid, and then, much closer to ${\\mathit{T}}_{\\mathit{c}}$ for strongly type-II systems, a crossover to the universality class of a charged superfluid. The primary focus of this paper is on the behavior in the presence of a penetrating magnetic field. In a clean system the vortex-lattice phase can melt due to thermal fluctuations; we estimate the phase boundary in a variety of regimes. Pinning of vortices due to impurities or other defects destroys the long-range correlations of the vortex lattice, probably replacing it with a new vortex-glass phase that has spin-glasslike off-diagonal long-range order and is truly superconducting, in contrast to conventional theories of ``flux creep.'' The properties of this vortex-glass phase are examined, as well as the critical behavior near the transition from the vortex-glass to the vortex-fluid phase. The crossover from lattice to vortex-glass behavior for weak pinning is also examined. Linear and nonlinear conductivity measurements and other experiments on the high-${\\mathit{T}}_{\\mathit{c}}$ superconductors Y-Ba-Cu-O and Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O are discussed in light of the results.

Although they have achieved impressive results, these methods still suffer from the following drawbacks: (1) They can only handle fixed integer upsampling factors, such as 2X, 3X, and 4X, and require training and storing corresponding models for each upsampling factor, which is infeasible in clinical practice; (2) They only perform feature extraction and reconstruction in the image domain. However, the aliasing artifacts produced in the image domain are structural and non-local. Therefore, using only the image domain cannot effectively reconstruct high-quality aliasing-free SR images. To address these issues, we develop a brand-new Dual-Domain Implicit Network (DuDoINet) for multi-modality MR image arbitrary-scale SR. Specifically, we propose a dual-domain learning scheme for multi-modality MR image SR, which allows the network to sufficiently exploit the frequency and image domain information in MR images. In addition, we design implicit attention to achieve arbitrary-scale upsampling of MR images, which utilizes a continuously differentiable function that generates pixel values from pixel coordinates. Furthermore, we designed a deformable cross-modality attention mechanism that can adaptively transfer high-frequency details from the T1 to the T2 modality, better integrating valuable complementary information from the T1 modality. Extensive and comprehensive experiments on healthy subjects and patient datasets demonstrate that our DuDoINet outperforms SOTA methods, demonstrating its great potential for clinical practice.", "authors": ["Guangyuan Li", "Wei Xing", "Lei Zhao", "Zehua Lan", "Zhanjie Zhang", "Jiakai Sun", "Haolin Yin", "Huaizhong Lin", "Zhijie Lin"], "year": 2023, "venue": "", "cited_by_count": 10, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Upsampling", "Modality (human–computer interaction)", "Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Aliasing"], "search_query": "image super resolution continuous scale arbitrary"}

Texture mapping has been used to provide a means by which images may themselves be used as display primitives. The work reported by this paper endeavors to carry this concept to its logical extreme by using interpolated images to portray three-dimensional scenes. The special-effects technique of morphing, which combines interpolation of texture maps and their shape, is applied to computing arbitrary intermediate frames from an array of prestored images. If the images are a structured set of views of a 3D object or scene, intermediate frames derived by morphing can be used to approximate intermediate 3D transformations of the object or scene. Using the view interpolation approach to synthesize 3D scenes has two main advantages. First, the 3D representation of the scene may be replaced with images. Second, the image synthesis time is independent of the scene complexity. The correspondence between images, required for the morphing method, can be predetermined automatically using the range data associated with the images. The method is further accelerated by a quadtree decomposition and a view-independent visible priority. Our experiments have shown that the morphing can be performed at interactive rates on today's high-end personal computers. Potential applications of the method include virtual holograms, a walkthrough in a virtual environment, image-based primitives and incremental rendering.

To address these problems, we propose a real-world character restoration network (RCRN) to effectively restore degraded character images, where character skeleton information and scale-ensemble feature extraction are utilized to obtain better restoration performance. The proposed method consists of a skeleton extractor (SENet) and a character image restorer (CiRNet). SENet aims to preserve the structural consistency of the character and normalize complex noise. Then, CiRNet reconstructs clean images from degraded character images and their skeletons.

{"openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2976035075", "doi": null, "title": "IMAGE RESTORATIONS USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES", "abstract": "Conventional methods for solving image restoration problems are typically built on an image degradation model and on some priors of the latent image. The model of the degraded image and the prior knowledge of the latent image are necessary because the restoration is an ill posted inverse problem. However, for some applications, such as those addressed in this thesis, the image degradation process is too complex to model precisely; in addition, mathematical priors, such as low rank and sparsity of the image signal, are often too idealistic for real world images. These difficulties limit the performance of existing image restoration algorithms, but they can be, to certain extent, overcome by the techniques of machine learning, particularly deep convolutional neural networks. Machine learning allows large sample statistics far beyond what is available in a single input image to be exploited. More importantly, the big data can be used to train deep neural networks to learn the complex non-linear mapping between the degraded and original images. This circumvents the difficulty of building an explicit realistic mathematical model when the degradation causes are complex and compounded. In this thesis, we design and implement deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for two challenging image restoration problems: reflection removal and joint demosaicking-deblurring. The first problem is one of blind source separation; its DCNN solution requires a large set of paired clean and mixed images for training. As these paired training images are very difficult, if not impossible, to acquire in the real world, we develop a novel technique to synthesize the required training images that satisfactorily approximate the real ones. For the joint demosaicking-deblurring problem, we propose a new multiscale DCNN architecture consisting of a cascade of subnetworks so that the underlying blind deconvolution task can be broken into smaller subproblems and solved more effectively and robustly. In both cases extensive experiments are carried out. Experimental results demonstrate clear advantages of the proposed DCNN methods over existing ones.", "authors": ["Zhixiang Chi"], "year": 2018, "venue": "MacSphere (McMaster University)", "cited_by_count": 1, "type": "dissertation", "concepts": ["Artificial intelligence", "Deep learning", "Computer science", "Dentistry", "Orthodontics"], "search_query": "real world image degradation mixed complex restoration"}

This review treats the ecology of prokaryotic viruses ('phages') in marine, freshwater and soil systems from a 'virus point of view'. The abundance of viruses varies strongly in different environments and is related to bacterial abundance or activity suggesting that the majority of the viruses found in the environment are typically phages. Data on phage diversity are sparse but indicate that phages are extremely diverse in natural systems. Lytic phages are predators of prokaryotes, whereas lysogenic and chronic infections represent a parasitic interaction. Some forms of lysogeny might be described best as mutualism. The little existing ecological data on phage populations indicate a large variety of environmental niches and survival strategies. The host cell is the main resource for phages and the resource quality, i.e., the metabolic state of the host cell, is a critical factor in all steps of the phage life cycle. Virus-induced mortality of prokaryotes varies strongly on a temporal and spatial scale and shows that phages can be important predators of bacterioplankton. This mortality and the release of cell lysis products into the environment can strongly influence microbial food web processes and biogeochemical cycles. Phages can also affect host diversity, e.g., by 'killing the winner' and keeping in check competitively dominant species or populations. Moreover, they mediate gene transfer between prokaryotes, but this remains largely unknown in the environment. Genomics or proteomics are providing us now with powerful tools in phage ecology, but final testing will have to be performed in the environment.", "authors": ["Markus G.

It can, by bypassing the peripheral nervous system, provide a means of communication for people suffering from severe motor disabilities or in a persistent vegetative state. In this paper, brain-signal generation tasks, noise removal methods, feature extraction/selection schemes, and classification techniques for fNIRS-based BCI are reviewed. The most common brain areas for fNIRS BCI are the primary motor cortex and the prefrontal cortex. In relation to the motor cortex, motor imagery tasks were preferred to motor execution tasks since possible proprioceptive feedback could be avoided. In relation to the prefrontal cortex, fNIRS showed a significant advantage due to no hair in detecting the cognitive tasks like mental arithmetic, music imagery, emotion induction, etc. In removing physiological noise in fNIRS data, band-pass filtering was mostly used. However, more advanced techniques like adaptive filtering, independent component analysis (ICA), multi optodes arrangement, etc. are being pursued to overcome the problem that a band-pass filter cannot be used when both brain and physiological signals occur within a close band. In extracting features related to the desired brain signal, the mean, variance, peak value, slope, skewness, and kurtosis of the noised-removed hemodynamic response were used. For classification, the linear discriminant analysis method provided simple but good performance among others: support vector machine (SVM), hidden Markov model (HMM), artificial neural network, etc. fNIRS will be more widely used to monitor the occurrence of neuro-plasticity after neuro-rehabilitation and neuro-stimulation.

Recently, frequency domainbased methods have achieved impressive improvement, yet they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios under extreme exposure conditions. This is due to the local convolutional receptive fields failing to model long-range dependencies in the spectrum, and the non-generative learning paradigm being inadequate for retrieving lost details from severely degraded regions. In this paper, we propose Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba (OSMamba), a novel exposure correction network that incorporates the advantages of state space models and generative diffusion models to address these limitations. Specifically, OSMamba introduces an omnidirectional spectral scanning mechanism that adapts Mamba to the frequency domain to capture comprehensive long-range dependencies in both the amplitude and phase spectra of deep image features, hence enhancing illumination correction and structure recovery. Furthermore, we develop a dual-domain prior generator that learns from well-exposed images to generate a degradation-free diffusion prior containing correct information about severely under- and over-exposed regions for better detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple-exposure and mixed-exposure datasets demonstrate that the proposed OSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Various kinds of degradation, including noise, blur, and low resolution, should be handled with these techniques. Restoration is important in many applications, including medical imaging, surveillance, photography, and remote sensing, where image quality will be critical to the correctness of analysis and decision. This article provides an all-inclusive review of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in image restoration, covering traditional methods as well as modern techniques like deep learning and transformer-based models. Traditional image restoration techniques include deblurring, denoising, and super-resolution based on mathematical models and handcrafted algorithms. These methods were indeed effective for certain types of noise or blur but generalized poorly to various real-world scenarios. Recent advances in machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have made data-driven approaches that learn directly from large datasets much more effective. Recently, transformer-based models-Vision Transformers and Swin Transformers-have shown the ability to capture global dependencies in images, leading to superior performance on complex restoration tasks. It also mentions the challenge of generalization across the type of degradation, say mixed noise or blur, and across different datasets. The proposed survey indicates the limitations of existing approaches, including computational cost and generalization challenges, and offers insights into possible directions for future research.

The PPP is important to maintain carbon homoeostasis, to provide precursors for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis, to provide reducing molecules for anabolism, and to defeat oxidative stress. The PPP shares reactions with the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and Calvin cycle and divides into an oxidative and non-oxidative branch. The oxidative branch is highly active in most eukaryotes and converts glucose 6-phosphate into carbon dioxide, ribulose 5-phosphate and NADPH. The latter function is critical to maintain redox balance under stress situations, when cells proliferate rapidly, in ageing, and for the 'Warburg effect' of cancer cells. The non-oxidative branch instead is virtually ubiquitous, and metabolizes the glycolytic intermediates fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as well as sedoheptulose sugars, yielding ribose 5-phosphate for the synthesis of nucleic acids and sugar phosphate precursors for the synthesis of amino acids. Whereas the oxidative PPP is considered unidirectional, the non-oxidative branch can supply glycolysis with intermediates derived from ribose 5-phosphate and vice versa, depending on the biochemical demand. These functions require dynamic regulation of the PPP pathway that is achieved through hierarchical interactions between transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. Consequently, the biochemistry and regulation of this pathway, while still unresolved in many cases, are archetypal for the dynamics of the metabolic network of the cell. In this comprehensive article we review seminal work that led to the discovery and description of the pathway that date back now for 80 years, and address recent results about genetic and metabolic mechanisms that regulate its activity. These biochemical principles are discussed in the context of PPP deficiencies causing metabolic disease and the role of this pathway in biotechnology, bacterial and parasite infections, neurons, stem cell potency and cancer metabolism.", "authors": ["Anna Stincone", "Alessandro Prigione", "Thorsten Cramer", "Mirjam M.
