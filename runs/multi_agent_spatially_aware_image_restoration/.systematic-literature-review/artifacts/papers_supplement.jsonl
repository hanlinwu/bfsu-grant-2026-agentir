Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.", "authors": ["Kaiwen Zhu", "Jinjin Gu", "Zhiyuan You", "Yu Qiao", "Chao Dong"], "year": 2024, "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "cited_by_count": 1, "type": "preprint", "concepts": ["Image (mathematics)", "Image restoration", "Computer science", "Cognitive science", "Psychology"], "search_query": "AgenticIR agentic image restoration"}

While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a \"scheduler\" for overall planning and multiple \"experts\" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system.

A revolutionary PRG (pre-reacted glass ionomer) filler technology--where fillers were prepared by the acid-base reaction of a fluoroaluminosilicate glass with polyalkenoic acid in water, was newly developed, and a new category as \"Giomer\" was introduced into the market. On fluoride release capability, SIMS examination revealed in vitro fluoride ion uptake by dentin substrate from the PRG fillers in dental adhesive. On bonding durability, it was found that the improved durability of resin-dentin bonds might be achieved not only via the strengthened dentin due to fluoride ion uptake from the PRG-Ca fillers, but also due to retention of relatively insoluble 4-AETCa formed around remnant apatite crystallites within the hybrid layer in 4-AET-containing self-etching adhesives. On ultramorphological study of the resin-dentin interface, TEM images of the PRG-Ca fillers revealed that the dehydrated hydrogel was barely distinguishable from normal glass fillers, if not for the concurrent presence of remnant, incompletely reacted glass cores. In conclusion, it was expected that uptake of fluoride ions with cariostatic effect from PRG-Ca fillers would endow dentin substrates with the benefit of secondary caries prevention, together with an effective and durable adhesion to dentin.", "authors": ["Kunio IKEMURA", "Franklin R.

Accordingly, at present, the recommendations aimed at reducing the prevalence of these conditions in the population are limited to a safer lifestyle including physical/mental exercise, a reduced caloric intake, and a proper diet in a convivial environment. The claimed health benefits of the Mediterranean and Asian diets have been confirmed in many clinical trials and epidemiological surveys. These diets are characterized by several features, including low meat consumption, the intake of oils instead of fats as lipid sources, moderate amounts of red wine, and significant amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables. In particular, the latter have attracted popular and scientific attention for their content, though in reduced amounts, of a number of molecules increasingly investigated for their healthy properties. Among the latter, plant polyphenols have raised remarkable interest in the scientific community; in fact, several clinical trials have confirmed that many health benefits of the Mediterranean/Asian diets can be traced back to the presence of significant amounts of these molecules, even though, in some cases, contradictory results have been reported, which highlights the need for further investigation. In light of the results of these trials, recent research has sought to provide information on the biochemical, molecular, epigenetic, and cell biology modifications by plant polyphenols in cell, organismal, animal, and human models of cancer, metabolic, and neurodegenerative pathologies, notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease. The findings reported in the last decade are starting to help to decipher the complex relations between plant polyphenols and cell homeostatic systems including metabolic and redox equilibrium, proteostasis, and the inflammatory response, establishing an increasingly solid molecular basis for the healthy effects of these molecules. Taken together, the data currently available, though still incomplete, are providing a rationale for the possible use of natural polyphenols, or their molecular scaffolds, as nutraceuticals to contrast aging and to combat many associated pathologies.", "authors": ["Manuela Leri", "Maria Scuto", "Maria Laura Ontario", "Vittorio Calabrese", "Edward J.

Aging is the leading risk factor for most chronic illnesses of old age, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

To date, no novel disease-modifying therapies have been shown to provide significant benefit for patients who suffer from these devastating disorders. Therefore, early diagnosis and the discovery of new targets and novel therapies are of upmost importance. Neurodegenerative diseases, like in other age-related disorders, the progression of pathology begins many years before the onset of symptoms. Many efforts in this field have led to the conclusion that exits some similar events among these diseases that can explain why the aging brain is so vulnerable to suffer neurodegenerative diseases.

Accordingly, there is an increasing need for appropriate approaches, which can be used to evaluate the suitability of different biomaterials for distinct clinical indications. The dorsal skinfold chamber is a sophisticated experimental model, which has been proven to be extremely valuable for the systematic in vivo analysis of the dynamic interaction of small biomaterial implants with the surrounding host tissue in rats, hamsters and mice. By means of intravital fluorescence microscopy, this chronic model allows for repeated analyses of various cellular, molecular and microvascular mechanisms, which are involved in the early inflammatory and angiogenic host tissue response to biomaterials during the initial 2-3 weeks after implantation. Therefore, the dorsal skinfold chamber has been broadly used during the last two decades to assess the in vivo performance of prosthetic vascular grafts, metallic implants, surgical meshes, bone substitutes, scaffolds for tissue engineering, as well as for locally or systemically applied drug delivery systems. These studies have contributed to identify basic material properties determining the biocompatibility of the implants and vascular ingrowth into their surface or internal structures. Thus, the dorsal skinfold chamber model does not only provide deep insights into the complex interactions of biomaterials with the surrounding soft tissues of the host but also represents an important tool for the future development of novel biomaterials aiming at an optimisation of their biofunctionality in clinical practice.", "authors": ["Matthias W.

However, defining the precise roles of each cell type has historically been impeded by the lack of discriminating markers and experimental systems capable of accurately identifying them. Our ability to distinguish microglia from monocytes in neuroinflammation has advanced with single-cell technologies, new markers and drugs that identify and deplete them, respectively. Nevertheless, the focus of individual studies on particular cell types, diseases or experimental approaches has limited our ability to connect phenotype and function more widely and across diverse CNS pathologies. Here, we critically review, tabulate and integrate the disease-specific functions and immune profiles of microglia and monocytes to provide a comprehensive atlas of myeloid responses in viral encephalitis, demyelination, neurodegeneration and ischemic injury. In emphasizing the differential roles of microglia and monocytes in the severe neuroinflammatory disease of viral encephalitis, we connect inflammatory pathways common to equally incapacitating diseases with less severe inflammation. We examine these findings in the context of human studies and highlight the benefits and inherent limitations of animal models that may impede or facilitate clinical translation.

Recently, this influence has been such that some feel we are in a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. This review will describe how soil erosion and sediment dynamics have (i) been used to assess the impact of humans on the planet and (ii) affected the global climate and influenced water security. Emphasis is placed on changes since the middle of the twentieth century, as this coincides with what many suggest is the start of the Anthropocene Epoch. Results and discussion The use of sediment archives has been instrumental in our understanding of how environmental systems have developed over time, both naturally and in response to anthropogenic activities. Additional information has come from measurement and monitoring programs, and tracing and fingerprinting studies. In turn, models have been developed that enable forecasting. Some of the main global impacts of enhanced soil erosion and changes in sediment dynamics and sediment composition include: changes in radiative energy balances and impacts on the cryosphere; the global carbon cycle; and greenhouse gas emissions. Impacts on water security include: effects on freshwater biota, including wild salmon populations; fluxes of contaminants, including microplastics; and reservoir and river channel sedimentation, including flooding. Sediment archives and monitoring programs have also been used to document the effect of mitigation measures and environmental policies. Conclusion Sediment archives enable us to assemble information over a variety of timescales (i.e., 10 0 to 10 5 years and longer) and a range of spatial scales (from sub-watershed to continental), in addition to environments ranging from arid to tropical to polar. Often the temporal resolution is better than other paleoenvironmental reconstruction approaches. As such, sedimentary records, when combined with measurement and monitoring approaches and other sources of information, have enabled us to determine changes in atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic systems, especially over the last 100 years. While soil erosion and sediment dynamics have provided a wealth of information and greatly enhanced our understanding of the role of humanity in modifying the planet, suggestions are given for further research.", "authors": ["Philip N.

However, the current methods are unsuitable for the long-term and large-scale PLES investigation. In this study, a modified method of PLES recognition is proposed based on the remote sensing image classification and land function evaluation technology. A multi-dimensional index system is constructed, which can provide a comprehensive evaluation for PLES evolution characteristics. For validation of the proposed methods, the remote sensing image, geographic information, and socio-economic data of five resource-based urbans (Zululand in South Africa, Xuzhou in China, Lota in Chile, Surf Coast in Australia, and Ruhr in Germany) from 1975 to 2020 are collected and tested. The results show that the data availability and calculation efficiency are significantly improved by the proposed method, and the recognition precision is better than 87% (Kappa coefficient). Furthermore, the PLES evolution characteristics show obvious differences at the different urban development stages. The expansions of production, living, and ecological space are fastest at the mining, the initial, and the middle ecological restoration stages, respectively. However, the expansion of living space is always increasing at any stage, and the disorder expansion of living space has led to the decrease of integration of production and ecological spaces.

Although several previous studies have reported that this flavonol has diverse health-promoting effects, evidence is still lacking for the underlying molecular mechanism of its anti-cancer efficacy. In this study, we examined the anti-proliferative effect of isorhamnetin on human bladder cancer cells and found that isorhamnetin triggered the gap 2/ mitosis (G2/M) phase cell arrest and apoptosis. Our data showed that isorhamnetin decreased the expression of Wee1 and cyclin B1, but increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>, and increased p21 was bound to Cdk1. In addition, isorhamnetin-induced apoptosis was associated with the increased expression of the Fas/Fas ligand, reduced ratio of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) expression, cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspases. Moreover, isorhamnetin inactivated the adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway by diminishing the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production due to impaired mitochondrial function. Furthermore, isorhamnetin stimulated production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, the interruption of ROS generation using a ROS scavenger led to an escape from isorhamnetin-mediated G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Collectively, this is the first report to show that isorhamnetin inhibited the proliferation of human bladder cancer cells by ROS-dependent arrest of the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induction of apoptosis.

Therefore, the hypothesis has been considered that increasing NA signaling in the CNS will prevent, or at least halt the progression of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

The protection mediated by STAT3 is attributed to its genomic actions as a transcription factor and other non-genomic roles targeting mitochondrial function and autophagy. As a transcription factor, STAT3 upregulates genes that are anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and pro-angiogenic, but suppresses anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Its suppressive effects on gene expression are achieved through competing with other transcription factors or cofactors. STAT3 is also linked to the modification of mRNA expression profiles in cardiac cells by inhibiting or inducing miRNA. In addition to these genomic roles, STAT3 is suggested to function protectively in mitochondria, where it regulates ROS production, in part by regulating the activities of the electron transport chain complexes, although our recent evidence calls this role into question. Nonetheless, STAT3 is a key player known to be activated in the cardioprotective ischemic conditioning protocols. Through these varied roles, STAT3 participates in various mechanisms that contribute to cardioprotection against different heart pathologies, including myocardial infarction, hypertrophy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and peripartum cardiomyopathy. Understanding how STAT3 is involved in the protective mechanisms against these different cardiac pathologies could lead to novel therapeutic strategies to treat them.", "authors": ["Zeina Harhous", "George W.

Wear of dental restoratives is a common phenomenon and the determination of the wear resistance of direct-restorative materials is a challenging task. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the wear resistance of novel glass ionomer cement by two wear-test methods and to compare the two wear methods.The wear resistance of a conventional glass ionomer cement (HiFi Advanced Health Care Kent, UK) and cements modified by including various percentages of nanoclays (1, 2 and 4 wt %) was measured by a reciprocating wear test (ball-on-flat) and Oregon Health and Sciences University's (OHSU) wear simulator. The OHSU wear simulation subjected the cement specimens to three wear mechanisms, namely abrasion, three-body abrasion and attrition using a steatite antagonist. The abrasion wear resulted in material loss from GIC specimen as the steatite antagonist forced through the exposed glass particles when it travelled along the sliding path.The hardness of specimens was measured by the Vickers hardness test. The results of reciprocation wear test showed that HiFi-1 resulted in the lowest wear volume 4.90 (0.60) mm³ (<i>p</i> < 0.05), but there was no significant difference (<i>p</i> > 0.05) in the wear volume in comparison to HiFi, HiFi-2 and HiFi-4. Similarly, the results of OHSU wear simulator showed that the total wear volume of HiFi-4 1.49 (0.24) was higher than HiFi-1 and HiFi-2. However, no significant difference (<i>p</i> > 0.05) was found in the OHSU total wear volume in GICs after nanoclay incorporation. The Vickers hardness (HV) of the nanoclay-reinforced cements was measured between 62 and 89 HV. Nanoclay addition at a higher concentration (4%) resulted in higher wear volume and wear depth. The total wear volumes were less dependent upon abrasion volume and attrition volume. The total wear depths were strongly influenced by attrition depth and to some extent by abrasion depth. The addition of nanoclay in higher wt % to HiFi did not result in significant improvement in wear resistance and hardness. Nonetheless, wear is a very complex phenomenon because it is sensitive to a wide number of factors that do not necessarily act in the same way when compared using different parameters.", "authors": ["Muhammad Amber Fareed", "Artemis Stamboulis"], "year": 2017, "venue": "Dentistry Journal", "cited_by_count": 10, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Glass ionomer cement", "Materials science", "Abrasion (mechanical)", "Wear resistance", "Composite material"], "search_query": "MAIR multi-agent image restoration degradation prior"}

All currently-approved therapies for the treatment of these diseases focus on controlling or modulating the immune (innate and adaptive) responses to limit demyelination and neuronal damage. The primary purpose of this review is to detail the pre-clinical data and proposed mechanism of action of novel drugs currently in clinical trial, with a focus on novel compounds that promote repair and regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). As the most recent advances have been made in the field of MS research, this review will focus primarily on this disease and its animal models. However, these compounds are likely to be effective for a range of indications with a neuroinflammatory component. Traditionally, MS was thought to proceed through two distinct phases. The first, predominantly inflammatory stage, is characterized by acute episodes of clinical relapse, followed by periods of partial or total recovery with an apparent absence of overall disease progression. In the vast majority of patients, this relapsing-remitting disease subsequently progresses into a second more chronic, neurodegenerative phase, which is characterized by oligodendrocyte damage and axonal destruction leading to brain atrophy and an accumulation of disability. Recent work has shown that rather than occurring independently, both the inflammatory and degenerative phases may run concurrently. This, combined with evidence that early therapeutic intervention slows accumulation of disability and delays progression, highlights the need for novel therapeutic approaches that promote repair and regeneration early in the disease trajectory. Such compounds may be used as monotherapies or in conjunction with classical anti-inflammatory therapies. This review will highlight novel therapies currently in clinical trial, and likely to appear in clinical practice in the near future, focusing on compounds that target the immune system and/or enhance endogenous repair mechanisms in the CNS.", "authors": ["Mahshad Kolahdouzan", "Naomi C.

In this paper, we consider an MIMO multicell system where multiple mobile users (MUs) ask for computation offloading to a common cloud server. We formulate the offloading problem as the joint optimization of the radio resources-the transmit precoding matrices of the MUs-and the computational resources-the CPU cycles/second assigned by the cloud to each MU-in order to minimize the overall users' energy consumption, while meeting latency constraints. The resulting optimization problem is nonconvex (in the objective function and constraints). Nevertheless, in the single-user case, we are able to compute the global optimal solution in closed form. In the more challenging multiuser scenario, we propose an iterative algorithm, based on a novel successive convex approximation technique, converging to a local optimal solution of the original nonconvex problem. We then show that the proposed algorithmic framework naturally leads to a distributed and parallel implementation across the radio access points, requiring only a limited coordination/signaling with the cloud.

This comprehensive assessment offers an in-depth overview of disaster management systems, methods, obstacles, and potential future paths. Specifically, it focuses on flood control, a significant and recurrent category of natural disasters. The analysis begins by exploring various types of natural catastrophes, including earthquakes, wildfires, and floods. It then delves into the different domains that collectively contribute to effective flood management. These domains encompass cutting-edge technologies such as big data analysis and cloud computing, providing scalable and reliable infrastructure for data storage, processing, and analysis. The study investigates the potential of the Internet of Things and sensor networks to gather real-time data from flood-prone areas, enhancing situational awareness and enabling prompt actions. Model-driven engineering is examined for its utility in developing and modeling flood scenarios, aiding in preparation and response planning. This study includes the Google Earth engine (GEE) and examines previous studies involving GEE. Moreover, we discuss remote sensing; remote sensing is undoubtedly a valuable tool for disaster management, and offers geographical data in various situations. We explore the application of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Spatial Data Management for visualizing and analyzing spatial data and facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation during floods. In the final section, the focus shifts to the utilization of machine learning and data analytics in flood management.

Unrolling methods were first proposed to develop fast neural network approximations for sparse coding. More recently, this direction has attracted enormous attention and is rapidly growing both in theoretic investigations and practical applications. The growing popularity of unrolled deep networks is due in part to their potential in developing efficient, high-performance and yet interpretable network architectures from reasonable size training sets. In this article, we review algorithm unrolling for signal and image processing. We extensively cover popular techniques for algorithm unrolling in various domains of signal and image processing including imaging, vision and recognition, and speech processing.

Arguably, many challenges can be overcome, and benefits leveraged, in this transition by the adoption of intelligent autonomous computer-based decision-making through the introduction of smart technologies, specifically artificial intelligence. Unlike other numerical or soft computing optimization methods, the control based on artificial intelligence allows the decentralized power units to collaborate in making the best decision of fulfilling the administrator’s needs, rather than only a primitive decentralization based only on the division of tasks. Among the smart approaches, reinforcement learning stands as the most relevant and successful, particularly in power distribution management applications. The reason is it does not need an accurate model for attaining an optimized solution regarding the interaction with the environment.

Utilising the methodology of Kitchenham and Charter, we performed a systematic search of the literature from 2016 to 2021 in Springer, Science Direct, arXiv, PubMed, ACM, IEEE, and Scopus. This review showed that algorithms using deep learning technology are superior to traditional IR methods in noise suppression, artifact reduction and structure preservation, in terms of improving the image quality of low-dose reconstructed images.

By designing the regularization terms carefully, iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms can produce promising results. Aided by the powerful deep learning techniques, learned regularization terms with convolution neural network (CNN) have attracted much attention and can further improve performance. In this article, to further enhance the performance of existing learnable regularization-based networks, we propose a learnable local–nonlocal regularization-based model called RegFormer for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we unroll the iterative scheme into a neural network and replace the gradient of handcrafted regularization terms with learnable kernels. The convolution layers are used to learn the gradient of local regularization, resulting in excellent denoising performance. In addition, the transformer-based encoders and decoders incorporate the learned nonlocal prior into the model, preserving the structures and details.

However, these models encounter challenges associated with limited annotated mammography public datasets. In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a noteworthy solution to addressing data scarcity by leveraging pretext and downstream tasks. Nevertheless, we recognize a notable scarcity of self-supervised learning models designed for the classification task in mammography. In this context, we propose a novel self-supervised learning model for limited-sample mammogram classification. Our proposed SSL model comprises two primary networks. The first is a pretext task network designed to learn discriminative features through mammogram reconstruction using a variational autoencoder (VAE). Subsequently, the downstream network, dedicated to the classification of mammograms, uses the encoded space extracted by the VAE as input through a simple convolutional neural network. The performance of the proposed model is assessed on public INbreast and MIAS datasets. Comparative analyzes are conducted for the proposed model against previous studies for the same classification task and dataset. The proposed SSL model demonstrates high performance with an AUC of 0.94 for density, 0.99 for malignant-nonmalignant classifications on INbreast, 0.97 for benign-malignant, 0.99 for density, and 0.99 for normal-benign-malignant classifications on MIAS. Additionally, the proposed model reduces computational costs with only 228 trainable parameters, 204.95K FLOPs, and a depth of 3 in mammogram classification. Overall, the proposed SSL model exhibits a robust network architecture characterized by repeatability, consistency, generalization ability, and transferability among datasets, providing less computational complexity than previous studies.

The primary challenge lies in addressing diverse degradations within a single model. While current methods primarily exploit task prior information to guide the restoration models, they typically employ uniform multi-task learning, overlooking the heterogeneity in model optimization across different degradation tasks. To eliminate the bias, we propose a task-aware optimization strategy, that introduces adaptive task-specific regularization for multi-task image restoration learning. Specifically, our method dynamically weights and balances losses for different restoration tasks during training, encouraging the implementation of the most reasonable optimization route. In this way, we can achieve more robust and effective model training.

However, the visual imaging quality inevitably suffers from several kinds of degradations (e.g., limited visibility, low contrast, color distortion, etc.) under complex weather conditions (e.g., haze, rain, and low-lightness). The degraded visual information will accordingly result in inaccurate environment perception and delayed operations for navigational risk. To promote the navigational safety of vessels, many computational methods have been presented to perform visual quality enhancement under poor weather conditions. However, most of these methods are essentially specific-purpose implementation strategies, only available for one specific weather type. To overcome this limitation, we propose to develop a general-purpose multi-scene visibility enhancement method, i.e., edge reparameterization- and attention-guided neural network (ERANet), to adaptively restore the degraded images captured under different weather conditions. In particular, our ERANet simultaneously exploits the channel attention, spatial attention, and reparameterization technology to enhance the visual quality while maintaining low computational cost. Extensive experiments conducted on standard and IWTS-related datasets have demonstrated that our ERANet could outperform several representative visibility enhancement methods in terms of both imaging quality and computational efficiency.

The inner-structure of the sinogram represents special characteristics of the data in the sinogram domain. By maintaining this structure while denoising, the noise can be obviously restrained. Therefore, we propose an LDCT denoising network namely Sinogram Inner-Structure Transformer (SIST) to reduce the noise by utilizing the inner-structure in the sinogram domain.

To address this issue, we propose a novel All-in-one Multi-degradation Image Restoration Network (AMIRNet) that can effectively capture and utilize accurate degradation representation for image restoration. AMIRNet learns a degradation representation for unknown degraded images by progressively constructing a tree structure through clustering, without any prior knowledge of degradation information. This tree-structured representation explicitly reflects the consistency and discrepancy of various distortions, providing a specific clue for image restoration. To further enhance the performance of the image restoration network and overcome domain gaps caused by unknown distortions, we design a feature transform block (FTB) that aligns domains and refines features with the guidance of the degradation representation.

SIDL contains diverse real-world images taken under various lighting conditions and environments. These images feature a wide range of lens contaminants, including water drops, fingerprints, and dust. Each contaminated image is paired with a clean reference image, enabling supervised learning approaches for restoration tasks.

It enables precise and detailed monitoring of operations, facilitating timely detection of potential hazards and efficient management. However, adverse weather conditions, such as atmospheric haziness and precipitation, can have a significant impact on image quality. When the atmosphere contains dense haze or water droplets, the incident light scatters, leading to degraded captured images. This degradation is evident in the form of image blur and reduced contrast, increasing the likelihood of incorrect assessments and interpretations by intelligent imaging systems (IIS). To address the challenge of restoring degraded images in hazy and rainy conditions, this paper proposes a novel multi-view knowledge-guided scene recovery network (termed MvKSR). Specifically, guided filtering is performed on the degraded image to separate high/low-frequency components. Subsequently, an en-decoder-based multi-view feature coarse extraction module (MCE) is used to coarsely extract features from different views of the degraded image. The multi-view feature fine fusion module (MFF) will learn and infer the restoration of degraded images through mixed supervision under different views.

To address these limitations, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPL), a framework that aims to improve prompt-task alignment through two complementary components: a Sparse Prompt Module (SPM) that efficiently captures degradation-aware representations while reducing redundancy, and a Contrastive Prompt Regularization (CPR) that explicitly strengthens task boundaries by incorporating negative prompt samples across different degradation types.

The separate task-specific DRN models and the fusion scheme are simultaneously trained by enforcing local and global supervision. Local supervision is applied on the two DRN submodules, and global supervision is applied on the data fusion submodule of the proposed model. Consequently, we both enable feature sharing across task-specific DRN models and control the image restoration behavior of the DRN submodules. An ablation study shows the strength of the hypothesized CMUDRN model, and experiments indicate that its performance is comparable or better than baseline DRN models on the single image deraining and desnowing tasks.

Accurate and effective identification and extraction of mangrove areas from remote sensing imagery is crucial for monitoring changes in the nearshore ecological environment. High-resolution remote sensing imagery is often difficult or expensive to obtain and usually lacks sufficient temporal coverage, so most monitoring of mangrove forests still relies on medium- or low-resolution imagery, resulting in inaccurate distribution of extracted mangrove areas. The super-resolution (SR) images generated by increasingly widely used deep learning (DL) models may be an alternative. To validate this, we evaluated the extraction of mangroves from SR images generated by four DL models (i.e., enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN), Real-ESRGAN, vast-receptive-field pixel attention network (VapSR), and image restoration methods using swin transformer (SwinIR)). The models were trained on paired (high-resolution) Chinese GF-1 satellite images and (low-resolution) Landsat 8 datasets. The performance of model fitting, vegetation indices, and extracted mangrove areas was evaluated using three commonly used classifiers (i.e., support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT)) in combination with ground-truth sampling points and public mangrove datasets. Results showed that: (1) the SR images generated by DL-based models can facilitate the extraction of mangrove features. (2) The quality evaluation metrics peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measurements (SSIM) cannot be regarded as absolute criteria for SR images, especially when the SR images were used for mangrove feature extractions. (3) The SR image generated by the VapSR model was best suited for extracting mangrove forests and performed even better than the original high-resolution images. (4) Taking a public dataset as a benchmark, the mangrove areas extracted from the SR image generated by the VapSR model were closer to the benchmark than the original Landsat-8 and GF-1. Overall, the DL-based SR models can enhance mangrove extractions and potentially have widespread applications.", "authors": ["Yu Hong", "Xiang Que", "Zhe Wang", "Xiaogang Ma", "Hui Wang", "Sanaz Salati", "Jinfu Liu"], "year": 2024, "venue": "Ecological Indicators", "cited_by_count": 23, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Mangrove", "Extraction (chemistry)", "Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Remote sensing"], "search_query": "SwinIR image restoration Swin Transformer"}

Recent progress on image deblurring always designs end-to-end architectures and aims at learning the difference between blurry and sharp image pairs from pixel-level, which inevitably overlooks the importance of blur kernels. This paper reveals an intriguing phenomenon that simply applying ReLU operation on the frequency domain of a blur image followed by inverse Fourier transform, i.e., frequency selection, provides faithful information about the blur pattern (e.g., the blur direction and blur level, implicitly shows the kernel pattern). Based on this observation, we attempt to leverage kernel-level information for image deblurring networks by inserting Fourier transform, ReLU operation, and inverse Fourier transform to the standard ResBlock. 1 × 1 convolution is further added to let the network modulate flexible thresholds for frequency selection.

In this paper, we develop an efficient convolutional network for image restoration by enhancing multi-scale representation learning.

However, to improve reconstruction performance, previous studies have mostly focused on building complex networks with a large number of parameters. How to effectively reduce the complexity of the model while improving the reconstruction performance to meet the needs of low-cost and real-time applications has become an important research direction. While state-of-the-art lightweight super-resolution methods are mainly based on convolutional neural networks, only few methods have been designed with Transformer, which show an excellent performance in image restoration tasks. To solve these problems, we propose a lightweight super-resolution network called image superresolution with channel-attention-embedded Transformer(CAET), which can achieve excellent super-resolution performance with a small number of parameters. Method CAET involves four stages, namely, shallow feature extraction, hierarchical feature extraction, multi-layer feature fusion, and image reconstruction. The hierarchical feature extraction stage is performed by a basic building block called channel-attention-embedded Transformer block(CAETB), which adaptively embeds channel attention(CA)into Transformer and convolutional features, hence not only taking full advantage of the convolutional network and Transformer in image feature extraction but also adaptively enhancing and fusing the corresponding features. Convolutional layers provide stable optimization and extraction results during early vision feature processing, and co-solution layers with spatially invariant filters can enhance the advection equivalence of the network. The stacking of convolutional layers can effectively increase the perceptual field of the network. Therefore, three cascaded convolutional layers are placed in front of CAETB to receive the features output from the previous module, and the LeakyReLU activation function is used to activate them. The features extracted by convolution layers are embedded with channel attention. To effectively adjust the channel attention parameters, we adopt a linear weighting method to combine channel attention with features from different levels. These features are then inputted into the swin Transformer layer(SwinIR)for further deep feature extraction. Given that increasing the network depth leads to saturation, we set the number of CAETB to 4 to maintain a balance between model complexity and super-resolution performance. The hierarchical information at different stages is helpful in interpreting the final reconstruction results. Therefore, CAET combines all the low- and high-level information from the deep feature extraction and multi-level feature fusion stages. In the image reconstruction phase, we use a convolution layer and the pixel shuffle layer to upsample the features to the corresponding dimensions of a high-resolution image. During the training stage, we use 800 images from the DIV2K dataset to train CAET, and we augment all training images by randomly flipping them vertically and horizontally to increase the diversity of the training data. For each mini-batch, we randomly crop image patches to a size of 64 × 64 pixels as our low-resolution(LR)images. We then optimize our network using the Adam algorithm and apply L1 loss as our loss function. Result We conduct experiments on five public datasets, namely, Set5, Set14, Berkeley segmentation dataset(BSD)100, Urban100, and Manga109, to compare the performance of our proposed method with that of six state-of-the-art models, including super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), cascading residual network(CARN), information multi-distillation network(IMDN), super-resolution with lattice block(LatticeNet), and image restoration using swin Transformer(SwinIR). We measure the performances of these methods using peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR)and structural similarity(SSIM)as metrics. Given that humans are highly sensitive to the brightness of images, we measure these metrics in the Y channel of an image. Experiment results show that the proposed method receives the highest PSNR and SSIM values and recovers more detailed information and more accurate texture compared with the state-of-the-art methods at ×2, ×3, and ×4 amplification factors. At the ×4 amplification factor, the PSNR of the proposed method is improved by 0. 09 dB on the Urban100 dataset and by 0. 30 dB on the Manga109 dataset compared to that of SwinIR. In terms of model complexity, CAET achieves a better performance with fewer parameters and multiply-accumulator operations compared to SwinIR, which also uses Transformer as the backbone of the network. Although CAET consumes more parameters and multiply-accumulator operations compared to IMDN and the LatticeNet, this method achieves significantly higher performance in terms of PSNR and SSIM. Conclusion The proposed CAET can effectively improve the image super-resolution reconstruction performance by fusing convolution and Transformer features and applies adaptive embedding channel attention to enhance the features. CAET effectively improves the image super-resolution performance while controlling the complexity of the whole network.

Despite delivering encouraging results, these approaches are all convolution-based, and are naturally weak in global relation modeling of sub-aperture images necessarily to characterize the inherent structure of light fields. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation built upon Transformers, by treating LFSR as a sequence-to-sequence reconstruction task. In particular, our model regards sub-aperture images of each vertical or horizontal angular view as a sequence, and establishes long-range geometric dependencies within each sequence via a spatial-angular locally-enhanced self-attention layer, which maintains the locality of each sub-aperture image as well. Additionally, to better recover image details, we propose a detail-preserving Transformer (termed as DPT), by leveraging gradient maps of light field to guide the sequence learning. DPT consists of two branches, with each associated with a Transformer for learning from an original or gradient image sequence. The two branches are finally fused to obtain comprehensive feature representations for reconstruction.

In this paper, we propose a novel Denoise Transformer for real-world image denoising, which is mainly constructed with Context-aware Denoise Transformer (CADT) units and Secondary Noise Extractor (SNE) block.

Specifically, the 3D convolution can extract the spatial correlation within a band, and spectral correlation between different bands, while the quasi-recurrent pooling operation is able to exploit global correlation along the spectrum. The other branch is composed of a series of Uformer blocks. The Uformer block uses window-based multi-head self-attention (W-MSA) mechanism and the locally enhanced feed-forward network (LeFF) to exploit the global and local spatial features. To fuse the features extracted by the two branches, we develop a bidirectional integration bridge (BI bridge) for better preserving the image feature information. Experimental results on synthetic and real HSI data show the superiority of our proposed network. For example, in the case of Gaussian noise with sigma 70, the PSNR value of our method significantly increases about 0.8 compared with other state-of-the-art methods.", "authors": ["Li Pang", "Weizhen Gu", "Xiangyong Cao"], "year": 2022, "venue": "Remote Sensing", "cited_by_count": 59, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Pattern recognition (psychology)", "Hyperspectral imaging", "Pooling"], "search_query": "SwinIR image restoration Swin Transformer"}

However, current methods are still far from practical usage. First, prior works focus narrowly on specific sub-tasks or settings, which do not align with diverse real-world applications. Second, their performance is sub-optimal due to limitations in dataset coverage, scale, and quality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the enhanced Depicted image Quality Assessment model (DepictQA-Wild). Our method includes a multi-functional IQA task paradigm that encompasses both assessment and comparison tasks, brief and detailed responses, full-reference and non-reference scenarios. We introduce a ground-truth-informed dataset construction approach to enhance data quality, and scale up the dataset to 495K under the brief-detail joint framework. Consequently, we construct a comprehensive, large-scale, and high-quality dataset, named DQ-495K. We also retain image resolution during training to better handle resolution-related quality issues, and estimate a confidence score that is helpful to filter out low-quality responses. Experimental results demonstrate that DepictQA-Wild significantly outperforms traditional score-based methods, prior VLM-based IQA models, and proprietary GPT-4V in distortion identification, instant rating, and reasoning tasks.

The implications for the economy and industries of this technological shift will be discussed. The foreseeable scenarios for the level and types of adoption that GAI might achieve - from useful analytical tool, invaluable assistant to the white-collar workers of the world to being trusted with a wide array of business and life-critical decision making. Both disruptive and premium service opportunities are foreseen. For instance general purpose models may provide quality service – such as copywriting – to overserved customers leaving human writers as the premium option. In this context, overserved customers would be those who would be satisfied with a non-human, potentially less creative content. On the other hand highly specialized models – specifically trained in a given domain and with access to proprietary knowledge can possibly provide a premium service over that provided by human experts.

Does unauthorized TDM process infringe the economic rights of the rightholders? How does the TDM-debate transform and transmute in the age of Generative AI? Generative AI tools create works that substitute the content creators whose very work that they learn from, and successively improvise themselves with every iteration. Generative AI, thus, also presents larger policy question as they substitute the romanticized human author that sits at the centre of copyright.

Its colours and unique designs have made it the best known of all Ghanaian, and perhaps even all West African textiles. Every design and colour has a distinct name and a meaning which is characteristic of the community in which it is produced. The case study sets out a preliminary analysis of the misappropriation and counterfeiting of the kente cloth by third parties and other countries and the need for a more comprehensive form of intellectual property right (IPR) protection for kente due to the inadequacies of its current IPR protection system. The analysis has wider implications for Africa's cultural heritage as the African Union and European Union have developed and desire to implement a continental strategy for developing geographical indications (GIs) in food and non-food products in Africa (AU-EU Continental Strategy).

Each individual would bring value to the start up through their background and experience. The start-up I selected was an interactive robotic toy called “Auti”. Project champion, Helen’s envisioned goal was for the toy to help children with autism learn positive behaviours. Our team consisted of two main individuals not including the product champion (Please refer to Appendix A to learn more about the team, team dynamics etc.). My individual responsibility in terms of contribution to the team was to establish a strategic business plan, including a growth strategy for the project. Gaining funding is a critical part of any start-up’s growth (Ministry of Economic Development, 2007). Financial planning forces companies to think about their goals. A common goal most companies have is the goal to grow (Ross et al., 2002). 1.2 Objectives The objective of this study was to identify the best suited funding sources, which I could then recommend “Auti” implement in order to help the company become a feasible, sustainable business. In order to make the most appropriate recommendations, I had to become financially literate. A study done in Canada found that weak financial literacy may be one of the biggest reasons start-up businesses do not succeed (Intuit, 2013). 1.3 Research questions My thesis looks to answer three specific questions. Questions one and two are specific to my individual research conducted into the angel investment industry in New Zealand. 1) How do angel investors in New Zealand view the angel investment industry in New Zealand? 2) What do angel investors expect high-tech start-ups to have in place before they would consider investing? Thesis question three is related to the main theory of the thesis. 3) How relevant is the “pecking order capital structure” theory to high-tech start-up companies in New Zealand? 1.4 Contribution This thesis contributes to practice as well as theory. My interviews with angel investors are “practice led”, meaning that the research led to a new understanding about practice (Edmonds et al., 2006). In terms of my own research, a new understanding was formed on angel investment in New Zealand in 2014. Specifically, a common list of things angels throughout New Zealand look for in “high-tech” start-ups, before they would consider investing, was identified. The main theory within this thesis is to do with the “pecking order capital structure”, in relation to high-tech start-ups, therefore contributing to research done around the pecking order theory. 1.5 Thesis layout This thesis is a reflection of the two facets of research that I conducted. The two approaches used were action-based research and in-depth Interviews. Action-based research aims to contribute both to the practical concerns of people in an immediate problematic situation and to further the goals of social science at the same time (Gilmore et al., 1986). Action-based research, as mentioned in this thesis, looks into the process that was taken to find the best suited funding sources for our start-up, “Auti”. An in-depth interview was conducted with angel investors in New Zealand to get a better understanding of angel investment in New Zealand. Specific focus is put on “angel investment” in New Zealand as this is the preferred choice of start-up capital for “Auti”. The thesis begins with a literature evaluation. The first section will evaluate funding source literature that influenced us to select angel investment funding as something we wanted to get a better understanding of. Further angel investment literature will be evaluated, including the gap in literature that my individual research into angel investment fills. Research question three looks to see if our start-up, “Auti”’s capital structure follows the “pecking order capital structure”, therefore there will also be a section within the literature review chapter that will include my main findings on past research, which has been conducted around the world, looking into if high-tech start-ups, such as “Auti”, follow the “pecking order capital structure”. The definition of high-tech firms, also known as new technology based firms, is not clear, its application differs significantly depending on time, space, and authors (Laranja &amp;Fontes, 1998; Fontes &amp; Coombs, 2001). One way it has been defined by Little (1977) is “independent owned business established for not more than twenty-five years and based on the exploitation of an invention or technological innovation implying substantial technological risks”. Following the literature review chapter, my research methodology is described, specifically with regards to my individual research into angel investment in New Zealand, explaining what I did, why, and problems that I faced. The thesis then follows with main findings from my individual qualitative research into the angel investment industry in New Zealand. The thesis conclusion will have six main sections. Sections will cover whether or not my research supports the literature, what my research contributions are, and an implementation section (recommending start-up funding implications for “Auti”). As my individual research looked into the angel investment industry in New Zealand, a majority of the implementation will be specific to what the “Auti” team should do in respect to approaching angel investment in order to have a higher chance of gaining investment. My recommended start-up funding implications will then be compared to the pecking order capital structure to show that it follows that structure. A section will also look into the limitations that my research faced. The last section will be recommendations in terms of further research needed to be conducted in order to support my research conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;", "authors": ["Anna Samoylova"], "year": 2014, "venue": "", "cited_by_count": 0, "type": "dissertation", "concepts": ["Champion", "Order (exchange)", "Public relations", "Product (mathematics)", "Excellence"], "search_query": "IPR-LLM image processing LLM reasoning chain"}

The largest and most persistent sources are located in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in a broad “dust belt” that extends from the west coast of North Africa, over the Middle East, Central and South Asia, to China. There is remarkably little large‐scale dust activity outside this region. In particular, the Southern Hemisphere is devoid of major dust activity. Dust sources, regardless of size or strength, can usually be associated with topographical lows located in arid regions with annual rainfall under 200–250 mm. Although the source regions themselves are arid or hyperarid, the action of water is evident from the presence of ephemeral streams, rivers, lakes, and playas. Most major sources have been intermittently flooded through the Quaternary as evidenced by deep alluvial deposits. Many sources are associated with areas where human impacts are well documented, e.g., the Caspian and Aral Seas, Tigris‐Euphrates River Basin, southwestern North America, and the loess lands in China. Nonetheless, the largest and most active sources are located in truly remote areas where there is little or no human activity. Thus, on a global scale, dust mobilization appears to be dominated by natural sources. Dust activity is extremely sensitive to many environmental parameters. The identification of major sources will enable us to focus on critical regions and to characterize emission rates in response to environmental conditions. With such knowledge we will be better able to improve global dust models and to assess the effects of climate change on emissions in the future. It will also facilitate the interpretation of the paleoclimate record based on dust contained in ocean sediments and ice cores.", "authors": ["Joseph M.

We propose that generative artificial intelligence (AI), which uses real images as a basis for learning, might further serve to show how deeply embedded the existing tropes and prejudices are within global health images. This in turn can perpetuate oversimplified social categorisations and power imbalances. Using the Midjourney Bot Version 5.1 (released in May, 2023), we attempted to invert these tropes and stereotypes by entering various image-generating prompts to create visuals for Black African doctors or traditional healers providing medicine, vaccines, or care to sick, White, and suffering children. However, despite the supposed enormous generative power of AI, it proved incapable of avoiding the perpetuation of existing inequality and prejudice. Although it could readily generate an image of a group of suffering White children or an image of Black African doctors (Figure 1, Figure 2), when we tried to merge the first two prompts, asking the AI to render Black African doctors providing care for White suffering children, in the over 300 images generated the recipients of care were, shockingly, always rendered Black (figure 3).Figure 2Prompt—a group of Black African doctors in the style of photojournalismView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Prompt—African doctors administer vaccines to poor White children in the style of photojournalismView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Occasionally the renderings for Black African doctors presented White people, effectively reproducing the saviour trope that we were trying to challenge (figure 4). This was also the case for traditional African healers prompts that often showed White men in exotic clothing (figure 5), also posing the question of gendered biases in such AI-generated global health images.Figure 5Prompt—Traditional African healer is helping poor and sick White childrenView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Eventually we were able to invert only one stereotypical global health image, by asking the AI to generate an image of a traditional African healer healing a White child; however, the rendered White child is wearing clothing that could be understood as a caricature of broadly defined African clothing and bodily practices (figure 6). When requested to produce images of doctors helping children in Africa, the AI generated images of doctors and patients with exaggerated and culturally offensive African elements such as wildlife (figure 7). In further probing the rendering bias, we discovered that AI couples HIV status with Blackness. Nearly all rendered patients for an HIV patient receiving care prompt (150 of 152) were rendered Black (figure 8).Figure 8Prompt—an HIV patient receiving care, photojournalismView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In summary, we were unable to achieve our initial goal of inverting stereotypical global health images, and instead we unwittingly created hundreds of visuals representing white saviour and Black suffering tropes and gendered stereotypes; these images were created despite the AI developers' stated commitment to ensure non-abusive depictions of people, their cultures, and communities.2MidjourneyTerms of service.https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/terms-of-serviceDate: July 21, 2023Date accessed: July 21, 2023Google Scholar This case study suggests, yet again, that global health images should be understood as political agents,1Charani E Shariq S Cardoso Pinto AM et al.The use of imagery in global health: an analysis of infectious disease documents and a framework to guide practice.Lancet Glob Health. 2023; 11: e155-e164Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 3Alenichev A Encountering semiotic misdirection in COVID-19 etiquette guides.Sci Technol Stud. 2022; 35: 97-111Crossref Google Scholar and that racism, sexism, and coloniality are embedded social processes manifesting in everyday scenarios, including AI.4WHOEthics and governance of artificial intelligence for health: WHO guidance. World Health Organization, Geneva2021Google Scholar In unpacking this bias, it is essential to mention that AI learns by absorbing existing images available online, which, in the case of global health, have historically been considered as disrespectful and abusive. In contrast, AI is seen as a way of generating universal knowledge and products devoid of contexts and social meanings. This view reinforces AI-produced global health imagery as a so-called neutral visual genre, thereby misdirecting attention away from the context of the emergence of the original images,5Grietens KP Friesen P Gerrets R Kuhn G Kingori P Douglas-Jones R Misdirection in global health: creating the illusion of (im)possible alternatives in global health research and practice.Sci Technol Stud. 2022; 35: 2-12Crossref Google Scholar and the system through which they are now reproduced. Global health actors are already using AI for their media, reports, and promotional materials, making this an urgent, complex, and extremely relevant problem for science and society. A promotional marketing image in a photojournalistic style was shared on behalf of the WHO in May, 2023. The AI-generation detection tool Hive suggests a 99% likelihood that this image is AI-rendered, and the picture shows visible compositing artefacts and irregularities common among heavily edited or AI-generated images. This discovery leads to a sharp question for the international global health community: what is our responsibility in reinforcing or challenging visual stereotypes regarding socially enacted markers of similarity and difference, and the symbolic violence they might entail? And who is accountable for generating these visuals and potential transgressions? An extensive version of this case study was presented at the Oxford Global Health and Bioethics International Conference in June, 2023. Even though we helped create these problematic images by running prompts, and are displaying them for a wide diverse audience, we do not endorse the content of these biased AI-generated images, nor the counterparts from which AI draws from, and we hope to facilitate a conversation about the history, present, and future of global health and its visual culture.

In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent’s experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine’s Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture—observation, planning, and reflection—each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.", "authors": ["Joon Sung Park", "Joseph O’Brien", "Carrie J.

This addresses the consequences of digital media use for young people's individual and social identities. The contributors explore how young people use digital media to share ideas and creativity and to participate in networks that are small and large, local and global, intimate and anonymous. They look at the emergence of new genres and forms, from SMS and instant messaging to home pages, blogs, and social networking sites. They discuss such topics as “girl power” online, the generational digital divide, young people and mobile communication, and the appeal of the “digital publics” of MySpace, considering whether these media offer young people genuinely new forms of engagement, interaction, and communication.ContributorsAngela Booker, danah boyd, Kirsten Drotner, Shelley Goldman, Susan C.

Optical techniques, such as RGB imaging, multi- and hyperspectral sensors, thermography, or chlorophyll fluorescence, have proven their potential in automated, objective, and reproducible detection systems for the identification and quantification of plant diseases at early time points in epidemics. Recently, 3D scanning has also been added as an optical analysis that supplies additional information on crop plant vitality. Different platforms from proximal to remote sensing are available for multiscale monitoring of single crop organs or entire fields. Accurate and reliable detection of diseases is facilitated by highly sophisticated and innovative methods of data analysis that lead to new insights derived from sensor data for complex plant-pathogen systems. Nondestructive, sensor-based methods support and expand upon visual and/or molecular approaches to plant disease assessment.

ROS possess multiple functions in cellular biology, with ROS generation a key factor in metallic NP-induced toxicity, as well as modulation of cellular signaling involved in cell death, proliferation, and differentiation. In this review, we briefly explained NP classes and their biomedical applications and describe the sources and roles of ROS in NP-related biological functions in vitro and in vivo.

Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called \"perceptual losses\"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.", "authors": ["Richard Zhang", "Phillip Isola", "Alexei A.

Microglia serve as brain macrophages but are distinct from other tissue macrophages owing to their unique homeostatic phenotype and tight regulation by the central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment. They are responsible for the elimination of microbes, dead cells, redundant synapses, protein aggregates, and other particulate and soluble antigens that may endanger the CNS. Furthermore, as the primary source of proinflammatory cytokines, microglia are pivotal mediators of neuroinflammation and can induce or modulate a broad spectrum of cellular responses. Alterations in microglia functionality are implicated in brain development and aging, as well as in neurodegeneration. Recent observations about microglia ontogeny combined with extensive gene expression profiling and novel tools to study microglia biology have allowed us to characterize the spectrum of microglial phenotypes during development, homeostasis, and disease.
