However, artifacts often inevitably appear in the generated results, leading to downgraded user experience and reduced performance in downstream tasks. This work aims to develop a plugin post-processing module for diverse generative models, which can faithfully restore images from diverse generative artifacts. This is challenging because: (1) Unlike traditional degradation patterns, generative artifacts are non-linear and the transformation function is highly complex. (2) There are no readily available artifact-image pairs. (3) Different from model-specific anti-artifact methods, a model-agnostic framework views the generator as a black-box machine and has no access to the architecture details. In this work, we first design a group of mechanisms to simulate generative artifacts of popular generators (i.e., GANs, autoregressive models, and diffusion models), given real images. Second, we implement the model-agnostic anti-artifact framework as an image-to-image diffusion model, due to its advantage in generation quality and capacity.

However, several attempts have been made to adopt diffusion models to noisy inverse problems either fail to achieve satisfactory results or require a few thousand iterations to achieve high-quality reconstructions. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based image restoration with error contraction and error correction (DiffEcc) method. Two strategies are introduced to contract the restoration error in the posterior sampling process. First, we combine existing CNN-based approaches with diffusion models to ensure data consistency from the beginning. Second, to amplify the error contraction effects of the noise, a restart sampling algorithm is designed. In the error correction strategy, the estimation-correction idea is proposed on both the data term and the prior term. Solving them iteratively within the diffusion sampling framework leads to superior image generation results.

In this paper, we propose an Iterative Token Evaluation and Refinement (ITER) framework for RWSR, which utilizes a discrete diffusion model operating in the discrete token representation space, i.e., indexes of features extracted from a VQGAN codebook pre-trained with high-quality (HQ) images. We show that ITER is easier to train than GANs and more efficient than continuous diffusion models. Specifically, we divide RWSR into two sub-tasks, i.e., distortion removal and texture generation.
