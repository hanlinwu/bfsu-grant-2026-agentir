Two divergent hypotheses have been proposed: hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; and failure of host protective immunity that results in unrestrained viral dissemination and organ injury. A key explanation for the inability to address this controversy has been the lack of diagnostic tools to evaluate immune function in COVID-19 infections. ELISpot, a highly sensitive, functional immunoassay, was employed in 27 patients with COVID-19, 51 patients with sepsis, 18 critically ill nonseptic (CINS) patients, and 27 healthy control volunteers to evaluate adaptive and innate immune status by quantitating T cell IFN-ɣ and monocyte TFN-α production. Circulating T cell subsets were profoundly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, stimulated blood mononuclear cells produced less than 40%-50% of the IFN-ɣ and TNF-α observed in septic and CINS patients, consistent with markedly impaired immune effector cell function. Approximately 25% of COVID-19 patients had increased IL-6 levels that were not associated with elevations in other canonical proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that COVID-19 suppresses host functional adaptive and innate immunity. Importantly, IL-7 administered ex vivo restored T cell IFN-ɣ production in COVID-19 patients. Thus, ELISpot may functionally characterize host immunity in COVID-19 and inform prospective therapies.", "authors": ["Kenneth E. Remy", "Monty B. Mazer", "David A. Striker", "Ali H.

In fact, the locus coeruleus (LC), the sole source of norepinephrine (NE) for >90% of the brain, is the first site of pathologic tau accumulation in human AD with axon loss throughout forebrain, including hippocampus. The dentate gyrus is heavily innervated by LC-NA axons, where released NE acts on β-adrenergic receptors (ARs) at excitatory synapses from entorhinal cortex to facilitate long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation. These synapses experience dysfunction in early AD before cognitive impairment. In the TgF344-AD rat model of AD, degeneration of LC-NA axons in hippocampus recapitulates human AD, providing a preclinical model to investigate synaptic and behavioral consequences. Using immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and brain slice electrophysiology in 6- to 9-month-old wild-type and TgF344-AD rats, we discovered that the loss of LC-NA axons coincides with the heightened β-AR function at medial perforant path-dentate granule cell synapses that is responsible for the increase in LTP magnitude at these synapses. Furthermore, novel object recognition is facilitated in TgF344-AD rats that requires β-ARs, and pharmacological blockade of β-ARs unmasks a deficit in extinction learning only in TgF344-AD rats, indicating a greater reliance on β-ARs in both behaviors. Thus, a compensatory increase in β-AR function during prodromal AD in TgF344-AD rats heightens synaptic plasticity and preserves some forms of learning and memory.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The locus coeruleus (LC), a brain region located in the brainstem which is responsible for attention and arousal, is damaged first by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The LC sends axons to hippocampus where released norepinephrine (NE) modulates synaptic function required for learning and memory. How degeneration of LC axons and loss of NE in hippocampus in early AD impacts synaptic function and learning and memory is not well understood despite the importance of LC in cognitive function. We used a transgenic AD rat model with LC axon degeneration mimicking human AD and found that heightened function of β-adrenergic receptors in the dentate gyrus increased synaptic plasticity and preserved learning and memory in early stages of the disease.", "authors": ["Anthoni M.

In L. infantum, usually causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, the CFAS gene is transcribed in both insect (extracellular) and host (intracellular) stages of the parasite life cycle. Tagged CFAS protein is stably detected in intracellular L. infantum but only during the early log phase of extracellular growth, when it shows partial localisation to the endoplasmic reticulum. Lipid analyses of L. infantum wild type, CFAS null and complemented parasites detect a low abundance CFAS-dependent C19Δ fatty acid, characteristic of a cyclopropanated species, in wild type and add-back cells. Sub-cellular fractionation studies locate the C19Δ fatty acid to both ER and plasma membrane-enriched fractions. This fatty acid is not detectable in wild type L. major, although expression of the L. infantum CFAS gene in L. major generates cyclopropanated fatty acids, indicating that the substrate for this modification is present in L. major, despite the absence of the modifying enzyme. Loss of the L. infantum CFAS gene does not affect extracellular parasite growth, phagocytosis or early survival in macrophages. However, while endocytosis is also unaffected in the extracellular CFAS nulls, membrane transporter activity is defective and the null parasites are more resistant to oxidative stress. Following infection in vivo, L. infantum CFAS nulls exhibit lower parasite burdens in both the liver and spleen of susceptible hosts but it has not been possible to complement this phenotype, suggesting that loss of C19Δ fatty acid may lead to irreversible changes in cell physiology that cannot be rescued by re-expression.

However, this widely used sensor suffers from severe accuracy and range limitations. To this end, we propose a honed-energy regularized and optimal supervised GAN (HEROS-GAN), which transforms low-cost sensor signals into high-cost equivalents, thereby overcoming the precision and range limitations of low-cost accelerometers. Due to the lack of frame-level paired low-cost and high-cost signals for training, we propose an Optimal Transport Supervision (OTS), which leverages optimal transport theory to explore potential consistency between unpaired data, thereby maximizing supervisory information. Moreover, we propose a Modulated Laplace Energy (MLE), which injects appropriate energy into the generator to encourage it to break range limitations, enhance local changes, and enrich signal details. Given the absence of a dedicated dataset, we specifically establish a Low-cost Accelerometer Signal Enhancement Dataset (LASED) containing tens of thousands of samples, which is the first dataset serving to improve the accuracy and range of accelerometers and is released in Github. Experimental results demonstrate that a GAN combined with either OTS or MLE alone can surpass the previous signal enhancement SOTA methods by an order of magnitude.

In MDD, several factors can simultaneously contribute to its development, which complicates its diagnosis. According to practical guidelines, antidepressants are the first-line treatment for moderate to severe major depressive episodes. Traditional treatment strategies often follow a one-size-fits-all approach, resulting in suboptimal outcomes for many patients who fail to experience a response or recovery and develop the so-called “therapy-resistant depression”. The high biological and clinical inter-variability within patients and the lack of robust biomarkers hinder the finding of specific therapeutic targets, contributing to the high treatment failure rates. In this frame, precision medicine, a paradigm that tailors medical interventions to individual characteristics, would help allocate the most adequate and effective treatment for each patient while minimizing its side effects. In particular, multi-omic studies may unveil the intricate interplays between genetic predispositions and exposure to environmental factors through the study of epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, gut microbiomics, and immunomics. The integration of the flow of multi-omic information into molecular pathways may produce better outcomes than the current psychopharmacological approach, which targets singular molecular factors mainly related to the monoamine systems, disregarding the complex network of our organism. The concept of system biomedicine involves the integration and analysis of enormous datasets generated with different technologies, creating a “patient fingerprint”, which defines the underlying biological mechanisms of every patient. This review, centered on precision medicine, explores the integration of multi-omic approaches as clinical tools for prediction in MDD at a single-patient level.

As cultural boundaries blur, the demand for seamless multilingual communication has become a critical technological challenge. This paper addresses the lack of robust solutions for real-time face-to-face translation, particularly for low-resource languages, by introducing a comprehensive framework that not only translates language but also replicates voice nuances and synchronized facial expressions. Our research tackles the primary challenge of achieving accurate lip synchronization across culturally diverse languages, filling a significant gap in the literature by evaluating the generalizability of lip sync models beyond English. Specifically, we develop a novel evaluation framework combining quantitative lip sync error metrics and qualitative assessments by human observers. This framework is applied to assess two state-of-the-art lip sync models with different architectures for Turkish, Persian, and Arabic languages, using a newly collected dataset. Based on these findings, we propose and implement a modular system that integrates language-agnostic lip sync models with neural networks to deliver a fully functional face-to-face translation experience. Inference Time Analysis shows this system achieves highly realistic, face-translated talking heads in real time, with a throughput as low as 0.381 s. This transformative framework is primed for deployment in immersive environments such as VR/AR, Metaverse ecosystems, and advanced video conferencing platforms. It offers substantial benefits to developers and businesses aiming to build next-generation multilingual communication systems for diverse applications. While this work focuses on three languages, its modular design allows scalability to additional languages. However, further testing in broader linguistic and cultural contexts is required to confirm its universal applicability, paving the way for a more interconnected and inclusive world where language ceases to hinder human connection.", "authors": ["Amirkia Rafiei Oskooei", "Mehmet S.

Ensuring the robustness and quality of water infrastructure is pivotal for sectors like agriculture, industry, and energy production. Machine learning (ML) offers potential for bolstering water infrastructure integrity and quality by analyzing extensive data from sensors and other sources, optimizing treatment protocols, minimizing water losses, and improving distribution methods. This study delves into ML applications in water infrastructure integrity and quality by analyzing English-language articles from 2015 onward, compiling a total of 1087 articles. Initially, a natural language processing approach centered on topic modeling was adopted to classify salient topics. From each identified topic, key terms were extracted and utilized in a semi-automatic selection process, pinpointing the most relevant articles for further scrutiny, while unsupervised ML algorithms can assist in extracting themes from the documents, generating meaningful topics often requires intricate hyperparameter adjustments. Leveraging the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTopic) enhanced the study’s contextual comprehension in topic modeling. This semi-automatic methodology for bibliographic exploration begins with a broad topic categorization, advancing to an exhaustive analysis of each topic. The insights drawn underscore ML’s instrumental role in enhancing water infrastructure’s integrity and quality, suggesting promising future research directions. Specifically, the study has identified four key areas where ML has been applied to water management: (1) advancements in the detection of water contaminants and soil erosion; (2) forecasting of water levels; (3) advanced techniques for leak detection in water networks; and (4) evaluation of water quality and potability.

Previous industrial revolutions have emphasized incorporating the latest state-of-the-art innovations and technologies to improve production processes, overseeing some of their long-term damaging impact on human beings. Our research contributes to the I5.0 practical implementation in factories by proposing the design of a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) industrial bot as a tool to assist workers of a small experimental factory in improving their daily working experience. The industrial bot closely tracks factory production and allows operators to monitor a few fundamental elements of their well-being via text queries, such as the pollution level and the maximum overtime hours per worker. It also provides factories with three valuable functions: faulty equipment discovery, root cause analysis, and synthetic data generation. These features originate from factory-customized data loaded into the OpenAI GPT4 language model (LM) presented in two industrial bot versions. The first is an offline version, created using a Langchain agent connected to the GPT4 LM through OpenAI APIs and visualized with Streamlit, an open-source front-end tool. The second is an online version produced by the GPT4 internal function that creates customs GPTs. We highlight both versions’ advantages and disadvantages to guide factories in considering the suitable environmental model when adopting I5.0.

Advanced AI techniques such as expert systems, neural networks, pattern recognition, fuzzy logic prediction, and other AI features can be leveraged in the creation of such an AI-based OS. Features of an AI-based OS may include abstraction, associative AI thinking, perceptual intelligence, contextual imagination, context-specific search, context priming, and various other AI methodologies. Integrating and using smart agents based on large language models (LLMs) face tough challenges that affect how well they work. These challenges include problems like not scheduling and sharing resources efficiently for agent requests on the LLM, difficulties in keeping track of context when agents interact with the LLM, and the complexity of blending different agents with various skills and specialties. The rising number and complexity of agents often cause problems like bottlenecks and inefficient use of resources. To tackle this, our paper introduces AIOS, a unique operating system that incorporates a large language model. This innovation gives the operating system a kind of \"intelligence\" and brings us closer to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). AIOS is designed to better manage resources, help agents switch between tasks smoothly, allow multiple agents to work at the same time, offer tools for agents, and control access to the system.

We use clustering techniques to explore data latent space and then implement Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to sample from the posterior distribution. The approach is designed for multi-objective optimization problems, where in the case of paint formulas, the objectives are the cost and the color difference from a reference formula. We demonstrate the feasibility of the idea by building and testing water-based acrylic paint formulas. The approach is general and can be applied to many different formulations at chemical or hardware-near levels. The paint industry is very competitive and new formulations must be assembled quickly while adhering to predefined criteria regarding sustainability, cost, and performance. In recent years with the advent of generative artificial intelligence approaches, large-scale and rapid assembly and design of formulations became possible. Current commercial approaches to develop new formulations are based on an AI-trained linear regression type approach that does not produce chemical-related formulations when trained with data at the hardware-near level and can also lead to a lower diversity of ideas since it is limited to extrapolating small changes around the reference samples. In this work, we implement a generative artificial intelligence approach that permits to sample of the posterior search space by using tools such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, to provide access to a wide diversity of potential new formulations. Our approach accomplishes this by employing a search sub-algorithm that relies on prescribed objective functions such as cost and color difference with a reference formulation, that is sampled for many different formulations, and pre-processes the data.

Four patients with bilateral facial nerve paralysis (Moebius syndrome) were included. They underwent two surgeries with free muscle transfers, one year apart from each other. The side of the face first operated on was rehabilitated with the traditional treatment, while the second side was rehabilitated with FIT-SAT. The FIT-SAT treatment includes video clips of an actor performing a unilateral or a bilateral smile to be imitated (FIT condition). In addition to this, while smiling, the participants close their hand in order to exploit the overlapped cortical motor representation of the hand and the mouth, which may facilitate the synergistic activity of the two effectors during the early phases of recruitment of the transplanted muscles (SAT). The treatment was also aimed at avoiding undesired movements such as teeth grinding. <i>Discussion</i>. Results support FIT-SAT as a viable alternative for smile rehabilitation after free muscle transfer. We propose that the treatment potentiates the effect of smile observation by activating the same neural structures responsible for the execution of the smile and therefore by facilitating its production. Closing of the hand induces cortical recruitment of hand motor neurons, recruiting the transplanted muscles, and reducing the risk of associating other unwanted movements such as teeth clenching to the smile movements.", "authors": ["Elisa De Stefani", "Anna Barbot", "Chiara Bertolini", "Mauro Belluardo", "Gioacchino Garofalo", "Nicola Bruno", "Bernardo Bianchi", "Andrea Ferri", "Pier Francesco Ferrari"], "year": 2021, "venue": "Neural Plasticity", "cited_by_count": 6, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Palsy", "Medicine", "Facial muscles", "Facial paralysis", "Intervention (counseling)"], "search_query": "agent image restoration LLM tool planning"}

In the last decades, the evolution in the sector of technologies applied to cultural heritage has taken on extraordinary accelerations in terms of accuracy and reliability of the measurement and restitution, as well as in the management of acquired data. In particular, the complex of these measurement and documentation actions are of fundamental importance if interfaced with other types of heterogeneous data acquired in different ways. Nevertheless, in face of such a complex framework of know- how, increasingly advanced technologies, dedicated programs and funding, meetings and debates, the establishment of specific Institutional Bodies to manage decision-making plans and their implementation, we continue to witness the frantic chasing of emergencies after the occurrence of catastrophic events. The spectrum of risks is more and more manifesting itself in its breadth: to the evidence of the effects due to Climate Change, those deriving from hydrogeological instability, from the lack of care of the territory and coasts, the devastation of an anthropic nature due to the senseless consumption of soil, and the unsustainable pressure of an uncultured, omnivorous tourism, are added with increasing frequency. This contribution deals in a general way with the theme of technologies for the knowledge of Cultural Heritage. It intends to critically question about the dangers inherent in the \"indiscriminate, unconscious and uncritical\" use of technologies for the knowledge of Cultural Heritage oriented towards its preservation. The aim is to prompt a discussion within the scientific community dealing with the documentation and conservation of cultural heritage in order to promote an indispensable culture of prevention and planned conservation, in which the intelligent relationship between Man and technology must be rediscovered.", "authors": ["Paolo Salonia"], "year": 2023, "venue": "The international archives of the photogrammetry, remote sensing and spatial information sciences/International archives of the photogrammetry, remote sensing and spatial information sciences", "cited_by_count": 2, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Witness", "Environmental ethics", "Cultural heritage", "Documentation", "Industrial heritage"], "search_query": "agent image restoration LLM tool planning"}

The survey first discusses three main applications of diffusion models in robotics: trajectory generation, policy representation, and data augmentation for offline reinforcement learning. We analyze how various foundation models-including large language models (LLMs), Video-Language models (Vid-LLMs), Visual-Language models (VLMs), and large vision models (LVMs)-are being combined with MDP-based methods such as reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search to enhance robotic capabilities. Our review categorizes and consolidates common requirements and challenges across various robotic tasks from multiple dimensions, offering a layered analysis of the technologies involved. We also analyze how these methods improve decisionmaking capabilities, overall performance, and training efficiency in robotic systems. Finally, we provide insights into potential issues and future directions for using foundation models and diffusion techniques with MDP-based approaches in robotics, aiming to guide future research in this rapidly evolving field.

Our research examines the capabilities and limitations of small and multilingual BERT models in the context of speech recognition and command conversion. We evaluate the performance of these models through a series of experiments, including the application of confusion matrices to assess their effectiveness. The findings reveal that larger models like multilingual BERT theoretically offer advanced capabilities but often demand more substantial resources and well-balanced datasets. Conversely, smaller models, though less resource-intensive, may sometimes provide more practical solutions. Our study underscores the importance of dataset quality, model fine-tuning, and efficient resource management in optimising VUIS. Insights gained from this research highlight the potential of neural networks to enhance and improve user interaction. Despite challenges in achieving a fully functional interface, the study provides valuable contributions to the VUIs development and sets the stage for future advancements in integrating AI with linguistic technologies. The article describes the development of a voice user interface (VUI) capable of recognising, analysing, and interpreting the Ukrainian language. For this purpose, several neural network architectures were used, including the Squeezeformer-CTC model, as well as a modified w2v-bert-2.0-uk model, which was used to decode speech commands into text. The multilingual BERT model (mBERT) for the classification of intentions was also tested. The developed system showed the prospects of using BERT models in combination with lightweight ASR architectures to create an effective voice interface in Ukrainian.

Such a trend underscored the potential of training LLMs with unlimited language data, advancing the development of a universal embodied agent. In this work, we introduce the NavGPT, a purely LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to reveal the reasoning capability of GPT models in complex embodied scenes by performing zero-shot sequential action prediction for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). At each step, NavGPT takes the textual descriptions of visual observations, navigation history, and future explorable directions as inputs to reason the agent's current status, and makes the decision to approach the target. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate NavGPT can explicitly perform high-level planning for navigation, including decomposing instruction into sub-goals, integrating commonsense knowledge relevant to navigation task resolution, identifying landmarks from observed scenes, tracking navigation progress, and adapting to exceptions with plan adjustment. Furthermore, we show that LLMs is capable of generating high-quality navigational instructions from observations and actions along a path, as well as drawing accurate top-down metric trajectory given the agent's navigation history. Despite the performance of using NavGPT to zero-shot R2R tasks still falling short of trained models, we suggest adapting multi-modality inputs for LLMs to use as visual navigation agents and applying the explicit reasoning of LLMs to benefit learning-based models.

In this work, we introduce EmbodiedGPT, an end-to-end multi-modal foundation model for embodied AI, empowering embodied agents with multi-modal understanding and execution capabilities. To achieve this, we have made the following efforts: (i) We craft a large-scale embodied planning dataset, termed EgoCOT. The dataset consists of carefully selected videos from the Ego4D dataset, along with corresponding high-quality language instructions. Specifically, we generate a sequence of sub-goals with the \"Chain of Thoughts\" mode for effective embodied planning. (ii) We introduce an efficient training approach to EmbodiedGPT for high-quality plan generation, by adapting a 7B large language model (LLM) to the EgoCOT dataset via prefix tuning. (iii) We introduce a paradigm for extracting task-related features from LLM-generated planning queries to form a closed loop between high-level planning and low-level control. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of EmbodiedGPT on embodied tasks, including embodied planning, embodied control, visual captioning, and visual question answering. Notably, EmbodiedGPT significantly enhances the success rate of the embodied control task by extracting more effective features.

This process demands skills in programming, data processing, and visualization tools, highlighting the need for a more intelligent, streamlined VA approach. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been developed as agents to handle various tasks with dynamic planning and tool-using capabilities, offering the potential to enhance the efficiency and versatility of VA. We propose LightVA, a lightweight VA framework that supports task decomposition, data analysis, and interactive exploration through human-agent collaboration. Our method is designed to help users progressively translate high-level analytical goals into low-level tasks, producing visualizations and deriving insights. Specifically, we introduce an LLM agent-based task planning and execution strategy, employing a recursive process involving a planner, executor, and controller. The planner is responsible for recommending and decomposing tasks, the executor handles task execution, including data analysis, visualization generation and multi-view composition, and the controller coordinates the interaction between the planner and executor. Building on the framework, we develop a system with a hybrid user interface that includes a task flow diagram for monitoring and managing the task planning process, a visualization panel for interactive data exploration, and a chat view for guiding the model through natural language instructions.

Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously.

Recent large language models (LLM) can embed rich semantic knowledge for agents in plan generation of complex tasks, while they lack the information about the realistic world and usually yield infeasible action sequences. In this paper, we propose a TAsk Planing Agent (TaPA) in embodied tasks for grounded planning with physical scene constraint, where the agent generates executable plans according to the existed objects in the scene by aligning LLMs with the visual perception models. Specifically, we first construct a multimodal dataset containing triplets of indoor scenes, instructions and action plans, where we provide the designed prompts and the list of existing objects in the scene for GPT-3.5 to generate a large number of instructions and corresponding planned actions. The generated data is leveraged for grounded plan tuning of pre-trained LLMs. During inference, we discover the objects in the scene by extending open-vocabulary object detectors to multi-view RGB images collected in different achievable locations. Experimental results show that the generated plan from our TaPA framework can achieve higher success rate than LLaVA and GPT-3.5 by a sizable margin, which indicates the practicality of embodied task planning in general and complex environments.", "authors": ["Zhenyu Wu", "Ziwei Wang", "Xiuwei Xu", "Jiwen Lu", "Haibin Yan"], "year": 2023, "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "cited_by_count": 18, "type": "preprint", "concepts": ["Computer science", "Embodied cognition", "Task (project management)", "Artificial intelligence", "Executable"], "search_query": "multi-agent visual task planning large language model"}

Research in this area uses and extends ideas about coordination from disciplines such as computer science, organization theory, operations research, economics, linguistics, and psychology. A key insight of the framework presented here is that coordination can be seen as the process of managing dependencies among activities. Further progress, therefore, should be possible by characterizing different kinds of dependencies and identifying the coordination processes that can be used to manage them. A variety of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and commonalities across disciplines are identified. Processes analyzed include those for managing shared resources, producer/consumer relationships, simultaneity constraints , and task/subtask dependencies .

To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x′ that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x̂ , from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: It allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this article, we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g., the choice of pre-trained language models, prompts, and tuning strategies.

A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students' needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.", "authors": ["Lijia Chen", "Pingping Chen", "Zhijian Lin"], "year": 2020, "venue": "IEEE Access", "cited_by_count": 3069, "type": "review", "concepts": ["Computer science", "Adaptability", "Personalized learning", "Artificial intelligence", "Curriculum"], "search_query": "multi-agent visual task planning large language model"}

The state-of-the-art TQA approaches are limited to handling only single-table questions. However, real-world TQA problems are inherently complex and frequently involve multiple tables, which poses challenges in directly extending single-table TQA designs to handle multiple tables, primarily due to the limited extensibility of the majority of single-table TQA methods. This paper proposes AutoTQA, a novel Auto nomous T abular Q uestion A nswering framework that employs multi-agent large language models (LLMs) across multiple tables from various systems (e.g., TiDB, BigQuery). AutoTQA comprises five agents: the User , responsible for receiving the user's natural language inquiry; the Planner , tasked with creating an execution plan for the user's inquiry; the Engineer , responsible for executing the plan step-by-step; the Executor , provides various execution environments (e.g., text-to-SQL) to fulfill specific tasks assigned by the Engineer ; and the Critic , responsible for judging whether to complete the user's natural language inquiry and identifying gaps between the current results and initial tasks. To facilitate the interaction between different agents, we have also devised agent scheduling algorithms. Furthermore, we have developed LinguFlow, an open-source, low-code visual programming tool, to quickly build and debug LLM-based applications, and to accelerate the creation of various external tools and execution environments. We also implemented a series of data connectors, which allows AutoTQA to access various tables from multiple systems.

There is a great need for new reinforcement learning methods that can efficiently learn decentralised policies for such systems. To this end, we propose a new multi-agent actor-critic method called counterfactual multi-agent (COMA) policy gradients. COMA uses a centralised critic to estimate the Q-function and decentralised actors to optimise the agents' policies. In addition, to address the challenges of multi-agent credit assignment, it uses a counterfactual baseline that marginalises out a single agent's action, while keeping the other agents' actions fixed. COMA also uses a critic representation that allows the counterfactual baseline to be computed efficiently in a single forward pass. We evaluate COMA in the testbed of StarCraft unit micromanagement, using a decentralised variant with significant partial observability. COMA significantly improves average performance over other multi-agent actor-critic methods in this setting, and the best performing agents are competitive with state-of-the-art centralised controllers that get access to the full state.", "authors": ["Jakob Foerster", "Gregory Farquhar", "Triantafyllos Afouras", "Nantas Nardelli", "Shimon Whiteson"], "year": 2018, "venue": "Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "cited_by_count": 1568, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Counterfactual thinking", "Computer science", "Reinforcement learning", "Baseline (sea)", "Observability"], "search_query": "multi-agent visual task planning large language model"}

Yet, the most natural and basic form of language use is dialogue. As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production. We consider the need for a grammatical framework that is designed to deal with language in dialogue rather than monologue, and discuss a range of implications of the account.", "authors": ["Martin J.

In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of \"universal,\" we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels.

To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents.

On the basis of over 200 fMRI studies, it tests alternative theoretical proposals that attempt to explain how several brain areas process information relevant for social cognition. The results suggest that inferring temporary states such as goals, intentions, and desires of other people-even when they are false and unjust from our own perspective--strongly engages the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). Inferring more enduring dispositions of others and the self, or interpersonal norms and scripts, engages the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), although temporal states can also activate the mPFC. Other candidate tasks reflecting general-purpose brain processes that may potentially subserve social cognition are briefly reviewed, such as sequence learning, causality detection, emotion processing, and executive functioning (action monitoring, attention, dual task monitoring, episodic memory retrieval), but none of them overlaps uniquely with the regions activated during social cognition. Hence, it appears that social cognition particularly engages the TPJ and mPFC regions. The available evidence is consistent with the role of a TPJ-related mirror system for inferring temporary goals and intentions at a relatively perceptual level of representation, and the mPFC as a module that integrates social information across time and allows reflection and representation of traits and norms, and presumably also of intentionality, at a more abstract cognitive level.", "authors": ["Frank Van Overwalle"], "year": 2008, "venue": "Human Brain Mapping", "cited_by_count": 1782, "type": "review", "concepts": ["Psychology", "Social cognition", "Temporoparietal junction", "Theory of mind", "Cognition"], "search_query": "multi-agent visual task planning large language model"}

In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent’s experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine’s Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture—observation, planning, and reflection—each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior.

However, there still exist two major limitations for these deep learning (DL)-based methods. Firstly, the noises contained in real corrupted images are very complex, usually neglected and largely under-estimated in most current methods. Secondly, existing DL methods are mostly trained on one pre-assumed degradation process for all of the training image pairs, such as the widely used bicubic downsampling assumption in the image super-resolution task, inevitably leading to poor generalization performance when the true degradation does not match with such assumed one. To address these issues, we propose a unified generative model for the image restoration, which elaborately configures the degradation process from the latent clean image to the observed corrupted one. Specifically, different from most of current methods, the pixel-wisely non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution, being with more flexibility, is adopted in our method to fit the complex real noises. Furthermore, the method is built on the general image degradation process, making it capable of adapting diverse degradations under one single model. Besides, we design a variational inference algorithm to learn all parameters involved in the proposed model with explicit form of objective loss. Specifically, beyond traditional variational methodology, two DNNs are employed to parameterize the posteriori distributions, one to infer the distribution of the latent clean image, and another to infer the distribution of the image noise.

In this context, the key issue lies in how to deal with different types of degraded images simultaneously. Existing methods fit joint regression models over multi-domain degraded-clean image pairs of different degradations. However, due to the severe ill-posedness of inverting heterogeneous degradations, they often struggle with thoroughly perceiving the degradation semantics and rely on paired data for supervised training, yielding suboptimal restoration maps with structurally compromised results and lacking practicality for real-world or unpaired data. To break the barriers, we present a Degradation-Aware Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (DA-RCOT) approach that models (all-in-one) image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we formalize image restoration with a residual-guided OT objective by exploiting the degradation-specific patterns of the Fourier residual in the transport cost. More crucially, we design the transport map for restoration as a two-pass DA-RCOT map, in which the transport residual is computed in the first pass and then encoded as multi-scale residual embeddings to condition the second-pass restoration. This conditioning process injects intrinsic degradation knowledge (e.g., degradation type and level) and structural information from the multi-scale residual embeddings into the OT map, which thereby can dynamically adjust its behaviors for all-in-one restoration. Extensive experiments across five degradations demonstrate the favorable performance of DA-RCOT as compared to state-of-the-art methods, in terms of distortion measures, perceptual quality, and image structure preservation. Notably, DA-RCOT delivers superior adaptability to real-world scenarios even with mixed degradations and shows distinctive robustness to both degradation levels and the number of degradations.", "authors": ["Xiaole Tang", "Xiang Gu", "Xiaoyi He", "Xin Hu", "Jian Sun"], "year": 2025, "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "cited_by_count": 5, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Degradation (telecommunications)", "Residual", "Image restoration", "Computer science", "Artificial intelligence"], "search_query": "all-in-one image restoration unified model degradation"}

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic prompt approach called Degradation Prototype Assignment and Prompt Distribution Learning (DPPD). Our approach decouples the degradation prior extraction into two novel components: Degradation Prototype Assignment (DPA) and Prompt Distribution Learning (PDL). DPA anchors the degradation representations to predefined prototypes, providing discriminative and scalable representations. In addition, PDL models prompts as distributions rather than fixed parameters, facilitating dynamic and adaptive prompt sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DPPD framework can achieve significant performance improvement on different image restoration tasks.

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs’ computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce “complexity experts” – flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance.

First, discover and handle the properties of the multi-domain in the target distribution formed by multiple weather conditions. Second, design efficient and effective operations for different degradations. To resolve this problem, most prior works focus on the multi-domain caused by different weather types. Inspired by inter&intra-domain adaptation literature, we observe that not only weather type but also weather severity introduce multi-domain within each weather type domain, which is ignored by previous methods and further limits their performance. To this end, we propose a degradation type and severity aware model, called UtilityIR, for blind all-in-one bad weather image restoration. To extract weather information from a single image, we propose a novel Marginal Quality Ranking Loss (MQRL) and utilize Contrastive Loss (CL) to guide weather severity and type extraction, and leverage a bag of novel techniques such as Multi-Head Cross Attention (MHCA) and Local-Global Adaptive Instance Normalization (LG-AdaIN) to efficiently restore spatial varying weather degradation. The proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods subjectively and objectively on different weather removal tasks with a large margin, and enjoy fewer model parameters.

As a typical multi-task learning, existing approaches focus on modeling either the specificity or commonality among different image restoration tasks. To exploit the unique strengths of both worlds, we propose a method of Image Pyramid Transformer coupled with Information Loss Regularization (IPT-ILR), in which the multi-scale architecture structure can excavate more information for multiple restoration tasks concurrently, while the learning strategy can identify the difference among multiple restoration tasks depending on the degree of information loss in each restoration task. Specifically, it first establishes a new Image Pyramid Transformer Network (IPT-Network) to accommodate multiple image restoration tasks. Given original degraded images, the IPT-Network exploits the image pyramid technique to establish a series of images with different scales, which are then restored by transformer-like auto-encoders. Moreover, the restored image on a low-level scale is referenced to assist restoring the degraded image on a high-level scale. Next, Information Loss Regularization (ILR) is presented to optimize the IPT-Network. ILR calculates the average distance between degraded images and their clean counterparts as the weights, which automatically implement different penalties for different image restoration tasks, thus avoiding the short-cut phenomenon for the easy task while encouraging the hard task. Extensive experiments have been conducted with 6 image restoration tasks in the all-in-one setting.

Recently, the methods with nonlocal self-similarity prior have led to a great improvement on many medical image restoration tasks. Nevertheless, the nonlocal technique is generally embedded with only one kind of constraint, such as sparsity or low-rank in the conventional model, which limits their abilities and show good performance on certain prior. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a novel medical image restoration method with multiple nonlocal-based prior regularizations. The surfacelet transformation is introduced to construct a cubic sparsity constraint to a group of nonlocal similar patches. Likewise, due to the self-similarity existed in the medical image, two extra kinds of nonlocal-based priors, nonlocal total variation and nonlocal weighted low-rank, are also exploited to constrain the local smoothness and nonlocal relationship jointly. In this way, each of the designed priors can well recover a group of patches with similar structure. And then, the designed priors are combined into a unified proposed optimization framework, which will obtain the advantages from all of them simultaneously.

Antimicrobial activity of neutrophils is mediated by release of antimicrobial peptides, phagocytosis as well as formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET).

This study focused on the influence of NET on the host cell functions, particularly on human alveolar epithelial cells as the major cells responsible for gas exchange in the lung. Upon direct interaction with epithelial and endothelial cells, NET induced cytotoxic effects in a dose-dependent manner, and digestion of DNA in NET did not change NET-mediated cytotoxicity. Pre-incubation of NET with antibodies against histones, with polysialic acid or with myeloperoxidase inhibitor but not with elastase inhibitor reduced NET-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that histones and myeloperoxidase are responsible for NET-mediated cytotoxicity. Although activated protein C (APC) did decrease the histone-induced cytotoxicity in a purified system, it did not change NET-induced cytotoxicity, indicating that histone-dependent cytotoxicity of NET is protected against APC degradation. Moreover, in LPS-induced acute lung injury mouse model, NET formation was documented in the lung tissue as well as in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

The requirement to tackle multiple degradations using the same model can lead to high-complexity designs with fixed configuration that lack the adaptability to more efficient alternatives. We propose DyNet, a dynamic family of networks designed in an encoder-decoder style for all-in-one image restoration tasks. Our DyNet can seamlessly switch between its bulkier and lightweight variants, thereby offering flexibility for efficient model deployment with a single round of training. This seamless switching is enabled by our weights-sharing mechanism, forming the core of our architecture and facilitating the reuse of initialized module weights. Further, to establish robust weights initialization, we introduce a dynamic pre-training strategy that trains variants of the proposed DyNet concurrently, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GPU hours. Our dynamic pre-training strategy eliminates the need for maintaining separate checkpoints for each variant, as all models share a common set of checkpoints, varying only in model depth. This efficient strategy significantly reduces storage overhead and enhances adaptability. To tackle the unavailability of large-scale dataset required in pre-training, we curate a high-quality, high-resolution image dataset named Million-IRD, having 2M image samples. We validate our DyNet for image denoising, deraining, and dehazing in all-in-one setting, achieving state-of-the-art results with 31.34\\% reduction in GFlops and a 56.75\\% reduction in parameters compared to baseline models.

The process of ferroptotic cell death is defined by the accumulation of lethal lipid species derived from the peroxidation of lipids, which can be prevented by iron chelators (e.g., deferiprone, deferoxamine) and small lipophilic antioxidants (e.g., ferrostatin, liproxstatin). This review summarizes current knowledge about the regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis and its association with several pathways, including iron, lipid, and cysteine metabolism. We have further discussed the contribution of ferroptosis to the pathogenesis of several diseases such as cancer, ischemia/reperfusion, and various neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), and evaluated the therapeutic applications of ferroptosis inhibitors in clinics.", "authors": ["Hong-Fa Yan", "Ting Zou", "Qing‐zhang Tuo", "Shuo Xu", "Hua Li", "Abdel Ali Belaidi", "Peng Lei"], "year": 2021, "venue": "Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy", "cited_by_count": 1334, "type": "review", "concepts": ["Programmed cell death", "Autophagy", "Apoptosis", "Lipid peroxidation", "Deferoxamine"], "search_query": "all-in-one image restoration unified model degradation"}
