Two divergent hypotheses have been proposed: hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; and failure of host protective immunity that results in unrestrained viral dissemination and organ injury. A key explanation for the inability to address this controversy has been the lack of diagnostic tools to evaluate immune function in COVID-19 infections. ELISpot, a highly sensitive, functional immunoassay, was employed in 27 patients with COVID-19, 51 patients with sepsis, 18 critically ill nonseptic (CINS) patients, and 27 healthy control volunteers to evaluate adaptive and innate immune status by quantitating T cell IFN-ɣ and monocyte TFN-α production. Circulating T cell subsets were profoundly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, stimulated blood mononuclear cells produced less than 40%-50% of the IFN-ɣ and TNF-α observed in septic and CINS patients, consistent with markedly impaired immune effector cell function. Approximately 25% of COVID-19 patients had increased IL-6 levels that were not associated with elevations in other canonical proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that COVID-19 suppresses host functional adaptive and innate immunity. Importantly, IL-7 administered ex vivo restored T cell IFN-ɣ production in COVID-19 patients. Thus, ELISpot may functionally characterize host immunity in COVID-19 and inform prospective therapies.", "authors": ["Kenneth E. Remy", "Monty B. Mazer", "David A. Striker", "Ali H.

Recently, the emergence and rapid adoption of advanced large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Google's PaLM, and Meta's Llama have shown great potential and sparked considerable global interest. However, the current surge lacks a study investigating the opportunities and challenges of implementing Generative AI (GenAI) in the construction sector, creating a critical knowledge gap for researchers and practitioners. This underlines the necessity to explore the prospects and complexities of GenAI integration. Bridging this gap is fundamental to optimizing GenAI's early stage adoption within the construction sector. Given GenAI's unprecedented capabilities to generate human-like content based on learning from existing content, we reflect on two guiding questions: What will the future bring for GenAI in the construction industry? What are the potential opportunities and challenges in implementing GenAI in the construction industry? This study delves into reflected perception in literature, analyzes the industry perception using programming-based word cloud and frequency analysis, and integrates authors' opinions to answer these questions. This paper recommends a conceptual GenAI implementation framework, provides practical recommendations, summarizes future research questions, and builds foundational literature to foster subsequent research expansion in GenAI within the construction and its allied architecture and engineering domains.", "authors": ["Prashnna Ghimire", "Kyungki Kim", "Manoj Acharya"], "year": 2024, "venue": "Buildings", "cited_by_count": 99, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Generative grammar", "Engineering", "Knowledge management", "Perception", "Bridging (networking)"], "search_query": "agent image restoration LLM tool planning", "score": 1.0, "subtopic": "", "rationale": "LLM adoption in construction industry, unrelated to image restoration or computer vision.", "alignment": {"task": "low", "method": "low", "modality": "low"}, "extraction": {"design": "Literature review on GenAI in construction", "key_findings": "Identifies opportunities and challenges for GenAI in construction sector", "limitations": "Not relevant"}}

The cases and synthesis presented here are organized around four key themes (resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge), which we approach from four social science fields (cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology). Social scientific approaches to human vulnerability draw vital attention to the root causes of climate change threats and the reasons that people are forced to adapt to them. Because vulnerability is a multidimensional process rather than an unchanging state, a dynamic social approach to vulnerability is most likely to improve mitigation and adaptation planning efforts.

Although adaptive capacity is a frequent topic of study in the resilience literature, there are few formal models. This paper introduces such a model and uses it to explore adaptive capacity by contrast with the opposite condition, or traps. In a socialecological rigidity trap, strong self-reinforcing controls prevent the flexibility needed for adaptation. In the model, too much control erodes adaptive capacity and thereby increases the risk of catastrophic breakdown. In a social-ecological poverty trap, loose connections prevent the mobilization of ideas and resources to solve problems. In the model, too little control impedes the focus needed for adaptation. Fluctuations of internal demand or external shocks generate pulses of adaptive capacity, which may gain traction and pull the system out of the poverty trap. The model suggests some general properties of traps in social-ecological systems. It is general and flexible, so it can be used as a building block in more specific and detailed models of adaptive capacity for a particular region.", "authors": ["Stephen R. Carpenter", "William A.

However, acquiring paired data in real-world scenarios poses a significant challenge. Unsupervised restoration approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a promising solution without requiring paired datasets. Yet, these GAN-based approaches struggle to surpass the performance of conventional unsupervised GAN-based frameworks without significantly modifying model structures or increasing the computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for existing restoration models. This strategy utilizes information from the previous stage as feedback to guide subsequent stages, achieving significant performance improvement without increasing the framework's inference complexity. The SC strategy comprises a prompt learning (PL) module and a restorer ($Res$Res). It iteratively replaces the previous less powerful fixed restorer $\\overline{Res}$Res¯ in the PL module with a more powerful $Res$Res. The enhanced PL module generates better pseudo-degraded/clean image pairs, leading to a more powerful $Res$Res for the next iteration. Our SC can significantly improve the $Res$Res 's performance by over 1.5 dB without adding extra parameters or computational complexity during inference. Meanwhile, existing self-ensemble (SE) and our SC strategies enhance the performance of pre-trained restorers from different perspectives. As SE increases computational complexity during inference, we propose a re-boosting module to the SC (Reb-SC) to improve the SC strategy further by incorporating SE into SC without increasing inference time. This approach further enhances the restorer's performance by approximately 0.3 dB. Additionally, we present a baseline framework that includes parallel generative adversarial branches with complementary \"self-synthesis\" and \"unpaired-synthesis\" constraints, ensuring the effectiveness of the training framework. Extensive experimental results on restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art unsupervised restoration methods.", "authors": ["Lin Xin", "Yuyan Zhou", "Jingtong Yue", "Chao Ren", "Kelvin C.

In the European Union (EU), the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is failing with respect to biodiversity, climate, soil, land degradation as well as socio-economic challenges.The European Commission's proposal for a CAP post-2020 provides a scope for enhanced sustainability. However, it also allows Member States to choose low-ambition implementation pathways. It therefore remains essential to address citizens' demands for sustainable agriculture and rectify systemic weaknesses in the CAP, using the full breadth of available scientific evidence and knowledge.Concerned about current attempts to dilute the environmental ambition of the future CAP, and the lack of concrete proposals for improving the CAP in the draft of the European Green Deal, we call on the European Parliament, Council and Commission to adopt 10 urgent action points for delivering sustainable food production, biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation.Knowledge is available to help moving towards evidence-based, sustainable European agriculture that can benefit people, nature and their joint futures.The statements made in this article have the broad support of the scientific community, as expressed by above 3,600 signatories to the preprint version of this manuscript.

In order to objectively reveal the research situation of land degradation, bibliometrix and biblioshiny software packages have been used to conduct data mining and quantitative analysis on research papers in the fields of land degradation during 1990–2019 (data update time was 8 April 2019) in the Web of Science core collection database. The results show that: (1) during the past 20 years, the number of papers on land degradation has increased. According to the number of articles, it is divided into four stages: a low-production exploration period, a developmental sprout period, expansion of the promotion period, and a high-yield active period. (2) Land-degradation research covers 93 countries or regions. The top five countries in terms of research volume are China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. China, the United States, and the United Kingdom are the most important countries for international cooperation in the field of land degradation. However, cooperation between countries is not very close overall. (3) Land degradation, degradation, desertification, remote sensing, soil erosion, and soil degradation are high-frequency keywords in the field of land degradation in recent years. (4) The research hotspots in the field of land degradation mainly focus on research directions such as restoration and reconstruction of land degradation, and sustainable management of land resources. (5) The themes of various periods in the field of land degradation are diversified, and the evolutionary relationship is complex. There are 15 evolutionary paths with regard to dynamic monitoring of land degradation, environmental governance of land degradation, and responses of land degradation to land-use change. Finally, the paper concludes that the research directions on land degradation in future include the process, mechanism, and effect of land degradation, the application of new technologies, new monitoring methods for land degradation, theory enhancement, methods and models of ecological restoration, reconstruction of degraded land, multidisciplinary integrated system research, constructing a policy guarantee system for the reconstruction of degraded land, and strengthening research on land resource engineering.", "authors": ["Hualin Xie", "Yanwei Zhang", "Zhilong Wu", "Tiangui Lv"], "year": 2020, "venue": "Land", "cited_by_count": 406, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Land degradation", "Desertification", "Sustainable land management", "China", "Land management"], "search_query": "prompt-based image restoration learning degradation", "score": 1, "subtopic": "", "rationale": "Land degradation bibliometric study, unrelated to image restoration.", "alignment": {"task": "low", "method": "low", "modality": "low"}, "extraction": {"design": "N/A", "key_findings": "N/A", "limitations": "N/A"}}

Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress in dehazing, however, they often suffer from either unreliable prompting guidance or inadequate global modeling. To bridge these gaps, we propose INP-Net, an Implicit Neural Prompting Network for remote sensing image dehazing. INP-Net introduces an implicit neural prompting mechanism that exploits learnable implicit neural representations (INR) in the YCbCr color space as degradation-insensitive prompts, which are dynamically injected into the RGB decoding pipeline. In addition, we design the Adaptive Sampling and Prior-enhanced (ASP) Transformer Block to enrich global feature diversity. The ASP comprises two core components: Adaptive Soft Sampling Self-Attention (ASSA), which performs probabilistic token selection to eliminate channel redundancy and enhance discriminative representations; and the Prior-Modulated Mixed-Scale Feed-Forward Network (PMFN), which leverages haze prior knowledge as a multi-scale modulator to guide local feature restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed INP-Net surpasses state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

In this study, the efficiency of ViT in image restoration is studied extensively. The ViT architectures are classified for every task of image restoration. Seven image restoration tasks are considered: Image Super-Resolution, Image Denoising, General Image Enhancement, JPEG Compression Artifact Reduction, Image Deblurring, Removing Adverse Weather Conditions, and Image Dehazing.

However, most existing weather restoration approaches are only capable of handling a specific type of degradation, which is often insufficient in real-world scenarios, such as rainy-snowy or rainy-hazy weather. Towards being able to address these situations, we propose a multi-weather Transformer, or MWFormer for short, which is a holistic vision Transformer that aims to solve multiple weather-induced degradations using a single, unified architecture. MWFormer uses hyper-networks and feature-wise linear modulation blocks to restore images degraded by various weather types using the same set of learned parameters. We first employ contrastive learning to train an auxiliary network that extracts content-independent, distortion-aware feature embeddings that efficiently represent predicted weather types, of which more than one may occur. Guided by these weather-informed predictions, the image restoration Transformer adaptively modulates its parameters to conduct both local and global feature processing, in response to multiple possible weather. Moreover, MWFormer allows for a novel way of tuning, during application, to either a single type of weather restoration or to hybrid weather restoration without any retraining, offering greater controllability than existing methods. Our experimental results on multi-weather restoration benchmarks show that MWFormer achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring much computational cost.

However, simply unifying multiple tasks into one universal architecture suffers from uncontrollable and undesired predictions. To address those issues, we explore prompt learning in universal architectures for image restoration tasks. In this paper, we present Degradation-aware Visual Prompts, which encode various types of image degradation, e.g., noise and blur, into unified visual prompts. These degradation-aware prompts provide control over image processing and allow weighted combinations for customized image restoration. We then leverage degradation-aware visual prompts to establish a controllable and universal model for image restoration, called ProRes, which is applicable to an extensive range of image restoration tasks. ProRes leverages the vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) without any task-specific designs.

The reigning paradigm in LDCT denoising is based on neural network models that learn data-driven image priors to separate noise evoked by dose reduction from underlying tissue signals. Naturally, the fidelity of these priors depend on the model's ability to capture the broad range of contextual features evident in CT images. Earlier convolutional neural networks (CNN) are highly adept at efficiently capturing short-range spatial context, but their limited receptive fields reduce sensitivity to interactions over longer distances. Although transformers based on self-attention mechanisms have recently been posed to increase sensitivity to long-range context, they can suffer from suboptimal performance and efficiency due to elevated model complexity, particularly for high-resolution CT images. For high-quality restoration of LDCT images, here we introduce DenoMamba, a novel denoising method based on state-space modeling (SSM), that efficiently captures short- and long-range context in medical images. Following an hourglass architecture with encoder-decoder stages, DenoMamba employs a spatial SSM module to encode spatial context and a novel channel SSM module equipped with a secondary gated convolution network to encode latent features of channel context at each stage. Feature maps from the two modules are then consolidated with low-level input features via a convolution fusion module (CFM). Comprehensive experiments on LDCT datasets with 25\\% and 10\\% dose reduction demonstrate that DenoMamba outperforms state-of-the-art denoisers with average improvements of 1.4dB PSNR, 1.1% SSIM, and 1.6% RMSE in recovered image quality.", "authors": ["Şaban Öztürk", "Özge Duran", "Tolga Çukur"], "year": 2024, "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "cited_by_count": 7, "type": "preprint", "concepts": ["Noise reduction", "Space (punctuation)", "State space", "State (computer science)", "Nuclear medicine"], "search_query": "image restoration transformer architecture efficient", "score": 4, "subtopic": "", "rationale": "Mamba-based CT denoising; medical imaging specific, tangentially related architecture.", "alignment": {"task": "low", "method": "medium", "modality": "low"}, "extraction": {"design": "N/A", "key_findings": "N/A", "limitations": "N/A"}}

Our model integrates an all-inone restoration module and a frequency decoupling module. The restoration module, combining AdverseGAN and stacked attention-integrated iterative recovery (AIIR) modules, restores images degraded by adverse weather. The frequency decoupling module employs a lightweight parallel network architecture to establish a correspondence between frequency-domain components and spatial-domain pixels, enabling direct extraction of crack edges and region information from the raw image.

Recently, Transformer models have achieved promising performance on image restoration tasks due to their powerful ability to model long-range dependencies. However, the quadratically growing complexity with respect to the input size makes them inapplicable to practical applications. In this paper, we develop an efficient convolutional network for image restoration by enhancing multi-scale representation learning. To this end, we propose an omni-kernel module that consists of three branches, i.e., global, large, and local branches, to learn global-to-local feature representations efficiently. Specifically, the global branch achieves a global perceptive field via the dual-domain channel attention and frequency-gated mechanism. Furthermore, to provide multi-grained receptive fields, the large branch is formulated via different shapes of depth-wise convolutions with unusually large kernel sizes. Moreover, we complement local information using a point-wise depth-wise convolution. Finally, the proposed network, dubbed OKNet, is established by inserting the omni-kernel module into the bottleneck position for efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 benchmark datasets for three representative image restoration tasks, including image dehazing, image desnowing, and image defocus deblurring.

Our algorithm employs a special feature reshaping operation, referred to as PixelShuffle, with a channel attention, which replaces the optical flow computation module. The main idea behind the design is to distribute the information in a feature map into multiple channels and extract motion information by attending the channels for pixel-level frame synthesis.

While conventional deep learning approaches have notably improved the image quality across various tasks, they still suffer from (i) the high storage cost needed for various task-specific models and (ii) the lack of interactivity and flexibility, hindering their wider application. Drawing inspiration from the pronounced success of prompts in both linguistic and visual domains, we propose novel Prompt-In-Prompt learning for universal image restoration, named PIP. First, we present two novel prompts, a degradation-aware prompt to encode high-level degradation knowledge and a basic restoration prompt to provide essential low-level information. Second, we devise a novel prompt-to-prompt interaction module to fuse these two prompts into a universal restoration prompt. Third, we introduce a selective prompt-to-feature interaction module to modulate the degradation-related feature. By doing so, the resultant PIP works as a plug-and-play module to enhance existing restoration models for universal image restoration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of PIP on multiple restoration tasks, including image denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light enhancement.

It involves methods to be developed to replicate the capabilities of biological vision. The computer vision’s goal is to surpass the capabilities of biological vision in extracting useful information from visual data. The massive data generated today is one of the driving factors for the tremendous growth of computer vision. This survey incorporates an overview of existing applications of deep learning in computational visual perception. The survey explores various deep learning techniques adapted to solve computer vision problems using deep convolutional neural networks and deep generative adversarial networks. The pitfalls of deep learning and their solutions are briefly discussed. The solutions discussed were dropout and augmentation. The results show that there is a significant improvement in the accuracy using dropout and data augmentation. Deep convolutional neural networks’ applications, namely, image classification, localization and detection, document analysis, and speech recognition, are discussed in detail. In‐depth analysis of deep generative adversarial network applications, namely, image‐to‐image translation, image denoising, face aging, and facial attribute editing, is done. The deep generative adversarial network is unsupervised learning, but adding a certain number of labels in practical applications can improve its generating ability. However, it is challenging to acquire many data labels, but a small number of data labels can be acquired. Therefore, combining semisupervised learning and generative adversarial networks is one of the future directions. This article surveys the recent developments in this direction and provides a critical review of the related significant aspects, investigates the current opportunities and future challenges in all the emerging domains, and discusses the current opportunities in many emerging fields such as handwriting recognition, semantic mapping, webcam‐based eye trackers, lumen center detection, query‐by‐string word, intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons, and landslides.", "authors": ["R.

Most of the existing methods intuitively employ the bottom-up paradigm by taking deraining as a preprocessing step for subsequent segmentation. However, our statistical analysis indicates that not only deraining would benefit segmentation (bottom-up), but also segmentation would further improve deraining performance (top-down) in turn. This motivates us to solve the rainy image segmentation task within a novel top-down and bottom-up unified paradigm, in which two sub-tasks are alternatively performed and collaborated with each other. Specifically, the bottom-up procedure yields both clearer images and rain-robust features from both image and feature domains, so as to ease the segmentation ambiguity caused by rain streaks. The top-down procedure adopts semantics to adaptively guide the restoration for different contents via a novel multi-path semantic attentive module (SAM).

Second, we create a new model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation (where individual streaks cannot be seen, and thus visually similar to mist or fog), and another component representing various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the first model, we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the binary rain streak map, the appearance of rain streaks, and the clean background, which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is critically beneficial, since its loss function can provide additional strong information to the network.

To address these issues, we propose a robust and efficient Diffusion-based Low-Light image enhancement approach, dubbed DiffLL. Specifically, we present a wavelet-based conditional diffusion model (WCDM) that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to produce results with satisfactory perceptual fidelity. Additionally, it also takes advantage of the strengths of wavelet transformation to greatly accelerate inference and reduce computational resource usage without sacrificing information. To avoid chaotic content and diversity, we perform both forward diffusion and denoising in the training phase of WCDM, enabling the model to achieve stable denoising and reduce randomness during inference. Moreover, we further design a high-frequency restoration module (HFRM) that utilizes the vertical and horizontal details of the image to complement the diagonal information for better fine-grained restoration. Extensive experiments on publicly available real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually, and it achieves remarkable improvements in efficiency compared to previous diffusion-based methods.

The primary challenge lies in addressing diverse degradations within a single model. While current methods primarily exploit task prior information to guide the restoration models, they typically employ uniform multi-task learning, overlooking the heterogeneity in model optimization across different degradation tasks. To eliminate the bias, we propose a task-aware optimization strategy, that introduces adaptive task-specific regularization for multi-task image restoration learning. Specifically, our method dynamically weights and balances losses for different restoration tasks during training, encouraging the implementation of the most reasonable optimization route. In this way, we can achieve more robust and effective model training. Notably, our approach can serve as a plug-and-play strategy to enhance existing models without requiring modifications during inference. Extensive experiments in diverse all-in-one restoration settings demonstrate the superiority and generalization of our approach.

Therefore, we propose an Unsupervised Deraining Generative Adversarial Network (UD-GAN) to tackle above problems by introducing self-supervised constraints from the intrinsic statistics of unpaired rainy and clean images. Specifically, we firstly design two collaboratively optimized modules, namely Rain Guidance Module (RGM) and Background Guidance Module (BGM), to take full advantage of rainy image characteristics: The RGM is designed to discriminate real rainy images from fake rainy images which are created based on outputs of the generator with BGM. Simultaneously, the BGM exploits a hierarchical Gaussian-Blur gradient error to ensure background consistency between rainy input and de-rained output. Secondly, a novel luminance-adjusting adversarial loss is integrated into the clean image discriminator considering the built-in luminance difference between real clean images and derained images.

However, due to being limited by the sensors, it is difficult to obtain high-resolution (HR) images from remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-domain super-resolution method devoted to reconstructing a low-resolution (LR) remote sensing image guided by an unpaired HR visible natural image. Therefore, an unsupervised visible image-guided remote sensing image super-resolution network (UVRSR) is built. The network is divided into two learnable branches: a visible image-guided branch (VIG) and a remote sensing image-guided branch (RIG). As HR visible images can provide rich textures and sufficient high-frequency information, the purpose of VIG is to treat them as targets and make full use of their advantages in reconstruction. Specially, we first use a CycleGAN to drag the LR visible natural images to the remote sensing domain; then, we apply an SR network to upscale these simulated remote sensing domain LR images. However, the domain gap between SR remote sensing images and HR visible targets is massive. To enforce domain consistency, we propose a novel domain-ruled discriminator in the reconstruction. Furthermore, inspired by the zero-shot super-resolution network (ZSSR) to explore the internal information of remote sensing images, we add a remote sensing domain inner study to train the SR network in RIG.

Specifically, we enhance the diffusion model in several aspects such as network architecture, noise level, denoising steps, training image size, and optimizer/scheduler. We show that tuning these hyperparameters allows us to achieve better performance on both distortion and perceptual scores. We also propose a U-Net based latent diffusion model which performs diffusion in a low-resolution latent space while preserving high-resolution information from the original input for the decoding process. Compared to the previous latent-diffusion model which trains a VAE-GAN to compress the image, our proposed U-Net compression strategy is significantly more stable and can recover highly accurate images without relying on adversarial optimization. Importantly, these modifications allow us to apply diffusion models to various image restoration tasks, including real-world shadow removal, HR non-homogeneous dehazing, stereo super-resolution, and bokeh effect transformation. By simply replacing the datasets and slightly changing the noise network, our model, named Refusion, is able to deal with large-size images (e.g., 6000 x 4000 x 3 in HR dehazing) and produces good results on all the above restoration problems.

However, artifacts often inevitably appear in the generated results, leading to downgraded user experience and reduced performance in downstream tasks. This work aims to develop a plugin post-processing module for diverse generative models, which can faithfully restore images from diverse generative artifacts. This is challenging because: (1) Unlike traditional degradation patterns, generative artifacts are non-linear and the transformation function is highly complex. (2) There are no readily available artifact-image pairs. (3) Different from model-specific anti-artifact methods, a model-agnostic framework views the generator as a black-box machine and has no access to the architecture details.

However, several attempts have been made to adopt diffusion models to noisy inverse problems either fail to achieve satisfactory results or require a few thousand iterations to achieve high-quality reconstructions. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based image restoration with error contraction and error correction (DiffEcc) method. Two strategies are introduced to contract the restoration error in the posterior sampling process. First, we combine existing CNN-based approaches with diffusion models to ensure data consistency from the beginning. Second, to amplify the error contraction effects of the noise, a restart sampling algorithm is designed. In the error correction strategy, the estimation-correction idea is proposed on both the data term and the prior term. Solving them iteratively within the diffusion sampling framework leads to superior image generation results.

AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents.

A revolutionary PRG (pre-reacted glass ionomer) filler technology--where fillers were prepared by the acid-base reaction of a fluoroaluminosilicate glass with polyalkenoic acid in water, was newly developed, and a new category as \"Giomer\" was introduced into the market. On fluoride release capability, SIMS examination revealed in vitro fluoride ion uptake by dentin substrate from the PRG fillers in dental adhesive. On bonding durability, it was found that the improved durability of resin-dentin bonds might be achieved not only via the strengthened dentin due to fluoride ion uptake from the PRG-Ca fillers, but also due to retention of relatively insoluble 4-AETCa formed around remnant apatite crystallites within the hybrid layer in 4-AET-containing self-etching adhesives. On ultramorphological study of the resin-dentin interface, TEM images of the PRG-Ca fillers revealed that the dehydrated hydrogel was barely distinguishable from normal glass fillers, if not for the concurrent presence of remnant, incompletely reacted glass cores. In conclusion, it was expected that uptake of fluoride ions with cariostatic effect from PRG-Ca fillers would endow dentin substrates with the benefit of secondary caries prevention, together with an effective and durable adhesion to dentin.", "authors": ["Kunio IKEMURA", "Franklin R.

Accordingly, at present, the recommendations aimed at reducing the prevalence of these conditions in the population are limited to a safer lifestyle including physical/mental exercise, a reduced caloric intake, and a proper diet in a convivial environment. The claimed health benefits of the Mediterranean and Asian diets have been confirmed in many clinical trials and epidemiological surveys. These diets are characterized by several features, including low meat consumption, the intake of oils instead of fats as lipid sources, moderate amounts of red wine, and significant amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables. In particular, the latter have attracted popular and scientific attention for their content, though in reduced amounts, of a number of molecules increasingly investigated for their healthy properties. Among the latter, plant polyphenols have raised remarkable interest in the scientific community; in fact, several clinical trials have confirmed that many health benefits of the Mediterranean/Asian diets can be traced back to the presence of significant amounts of these molecules, even though, in some cases, contradictory results have been reported, which highlights the need for further investigation. In light of the results of these trials, recent research has sought to provide information on the biochemical, molecular, epigenetic, and cell biology modifications by plant polyphenols in cell, organismal, animal, and human models of cancer, metabolic, and neurodegenerative pathologies, notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease. The findings reported in the last decade are starting to help to decipher the complex relations between plant polyphenols and cell homeostatic systems including metabolic and redox equilibrium, proteostasis, and the inflammatory response, establishing an increasingly solid molecular basis for the healthy effects of these molecules. Taken together, the data currently available, though still incomplete, are providing a rationale for the possible use of natural polyphenols, or their molecular scaffolds, as nutraceuticals to contrast aging and to combat many associated pathologies.", "authors": ["Manuela Leri", "Maria Scuto", "Maria Laura Ontario", "Vittorio Calabrese", "Edward J.

Accordingly, there is an increasing need for appropriate approaches, which can be used to evaluate the suitability of different biomaterials for distinct clinical indications. The dorsal skinfold chamber is a sophisticated experimental model, which has been proven to be extremely valuable for the systematic in vivo analysis of the dynamic interaction of small biomaterial implants with the surrounding host tissue in rats, hamsters and mice. By means of intravital fluorescence microscopy, this chronic model allows for repeated analyses of various cellular, molecular and microvascular mechanisms, which are involved in the early inflammatory and angiogenic host tissue response to biomaterials during the initial 2-3 weeks after implantation. Therefore, the dorsal skinfold chamber has been broadly used during the last two decades to assess the in vivo performance of prosthetic vascular grafts, metallic implants, surgical meshes, bone substitutes, scaffolds for tissue engineering, as well as for locally or systemically applied drug delivery systems. These studies have contributed to identify basic material properties determining the biocompatibility of the implants and vascular ingrowth into their surface or internal structures.

Our ability to distinguish microglia from monocytes in neuroinflammation has advanced with single-cell technologies, new markers and drugs that identify and deplete them, respectively. Nevertheless, the focus of individual studies on particular cell types, diseases or experimental approaches has limited our ability to connect phenotype and function more widely and across diverse CNS pathologies. Here, we critically review, tabulate and integrate the disease-specific functions and immune profiles of microglia and monocytes to provide a comprehensive atlas of myeloid responses in viral encephalitis, demyelination, neurodegeneration and ischemic injury. In emphasizing the differential roles of microglia and monocytes in the severe neuroinflammatory disease of viral encephalitis, we connect inflammatory pathways common to equally incapacitating diseases with less severe inflammation. We examine these findings in the context of human studies and highlight the benefits and inherent limitations of animal models that may impede or facilitate clinical translation.

Recently, this influence has been such that some feel we are in a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. This review will describe how soil erosion and sediment dynamics have (i) been used to assess the impact of humans on the planet and (ii) affected the global climate and influenced water security. Emphasis is placed on changes since the middle of the twentieth century, as this coincides with what many suggest is the start of the Anthropocene Epoch. Results and discussion The use of sediment archives has been instrumental in our understanding of how environmental systems have developed over time, both naturally and in response to anthropogenic activities. Additional information has come from measurement and monitoring programs, and tracing and fingerprinting studies. In turn, models have been developed that enable forecasting. Some of the main global impacts of enhanced soil erosion and changes in sediment dynamics and sediment composition include: changes in radiative energy balances and impacts on the cryosphere; the global carbon cycle; and greenhouse gas emissions. Impacts on water security include: effects on freshwater biota, including wild salmon populations; fluxes of contaminants, including microplastics; and reservoir and river channel sedimentation, including flooding. Sediment archives and monitoring programs have also been used to document the effect of mitigation measures and environmental policies. Conclusion Sediment archives enable us to assemble information over a variety of timescales (i.e., 10 0 to 10 5 years and longer) and a range of spatial scales (from sub-watershed to continental), in addition to environments ranging from arid to tropical to polar. Often the temporal resolution is better than other paleoenvironmental reconstruction approaches. As such, sedimentary records, when combined with measurement and monitoring approaches and other sources of information, have enabled us to determine changes in atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic systems, especially over the last 100 years. While soil erosion and sediment dynamics have provided a wealth of information and greatly enhanced our understanding of the role of humanity in modifying the planet, suggestions are given for further research.", "authors": ["Philip N.

However, the current methods are unsuitable for the long-term and large-scale PLES investigation. In this study, a modified method of PLES recognition is proposed based on the remote sensing image classification and land function evaluation technology. A multi-dimensional index system is constructed, which can provide a comprehensive evaluation for PLES evolution characteristics. For validation of the proposed methods, the remote sensing image, geographic information, and socio-economic data of five resource-based urbans (Zululand in South Africa, Xuzhou in China, Lota in Chile, Surf Coast in Australia, and Ruhr in Germany) from 1975 to 2020 are collected and tested. The results show that the data availability and calculation efficiency are significantly improved by the proposed method, and the recognition precision is better than 87% (Kappa coefficient). Furthermore, the PLES evolution characteristics show obvious differences at the different urban development stages. The expansions of production, living, and ecological space are fastest at the mining, the initial, and the middle ecological restoration stages, respectively. However, the expansion of living space is always increasing at any stage, and the disorder expansion of living space has led to the decrease of integration of production and ecological spaces. Therefore, the active polices should be formulated to guide the transformation of the living space expansion from jumping-type and spreading-type to filling-type, and the renovation of abandoned industrial and mining lands should be encouraged.", "authors": ["Yuanyuan Tao", "Qianxin Wang"], "year": 2021, "venue": "Remote Sensing", "cited_by_count": 43, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Xuzhou", "Geography", "Resource (disambiguation)", "Sustainable development", "Environmental resource management"], "search_query": "MAIR multi-agent image restoration degradation prior", "score": 6.0, "subtopic": "Foundation Models Vision", "rationale": "Foundation model applied to vision tasks", "alignment": {"task": "medium", "method": "high", "modality": "high"}, "extraction": {"design": "Adapting foundation model (SAM/CLIP) to downstream vision tasks", "key_findings": "Zero-shot generalization from large-scale pretraining", "limitations": "Degraded input sensitivity, prompt engineering required"}}

Although several previous studies have reported that this flavonol has diverse health-promoting effects, evidence is still lacking for the underlying molecular mechanism of its anti-cancer efficacy. In this study, we examined the anti-proliferative effect of isorhamnetin on human bladder cancer cells and found that isorhamnetin triggered the gap 2/ mitosis (G2/M) phase cell arrest and apoptosis. Our data showed that isorhamnetin decreased the expression of Wee1 and cyclin B1, but increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>, and increased p21 was bound to Cdk1. In addition, isorhamnetin-induced apoptosis was associated with the increased expression of the Fas/Fas ligand, reduced ratio of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) expression, cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspases. Moreover, isorhamnetin inactivated the adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway by diminishing the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production due to impaired mitochondrial function. Furthermore, isorhamnetin stimulated production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, the interruption of ROS generation using a ROS scavenger led to an escape from isorhamnetin-mediated G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Collectively, this is the first report to show that isorhamnetin inhibited the proliferation of human bladder cancer cells by ROS-dependent arrest of the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induction of apoptosis. Therefore, our results provide an important basis for the interpretation of the anti-cancer mechanism of isorhamnetin in bladder cancer cells and support the rationale for the need to evaluate more precise molecular mechanisms and in vivo anti-cancer properties.", "authors": ["Cheol Park", "Hee‐Jae Cha", "Eun‐Ok Choi", "Hyesook Lee", "Hyun Hwangbo", "Seon Yeong Ji", "Min Yeong Kim", "So Young Kim", "Su Hyun Hong", "JaeHun Cheong", "Gi‐Young Kim", "Seok Joong Yun", "Hye Jin Hwang", "Wun‐Jae Kim", "Yung Hyun Choi"], "year": 2019, "venue": "Cancers", "cited_by_count": 51, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Apoptosis", "Reactive oxygen species", "Signal transduction", "Cell biology", "Isorhamnetin"], "search_query": "MAIR multi-agent image restoration degradation prior", "score": 1.0, "subtopic": "", "rationale": "Clearly irrelevant non-vision/medical/biology domain", "alignment": {"task": "low", "method": "low", "modality": "low"}, "extraction": {"design": "N/A", "key_findings": "N/A", "limitations": "N/A"}}

However, targeting the noradrenergic system also seems a promising strategy, since more recent studies revealed that in post-mortem tissue from patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders there is a robust correlation between cognitive decline and loss of neurons from the Locus coeruleus (LC), a system with diffuse noradrenaline (NA) innervation in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, the hypothesis has been considered that increasing NA signaling in the CNS will prevent, or at least halt the progression of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. A hallmark of the age- and neurodegeneration-related cognitive decline is reduced neurogenesis. We here discuss noradrenergic dysfunction in AD-related cognitive decline in humans and its potential involvement in AD pathology and disease progression. We also focus on animal models to allow the validation of the noradrenergic hypothesis of AD, including those based upon the immunotoxin-mediated ablation of LC based on saporin, a protein synthesis interfering agent, which offers selective and graded demise of LC neurons, Finally, we address how astrocytes, an abundant and functionally heterogeneous cell type of neuroglia maintaining homeostasis, may participate in the regulation of neurogenesis, a new strategy for preventing LC neuron loss.", "authors": ["Giampiero Leanza", "Rosario Gulino", "Robert Zorec"], "year": 2018, "venue": "Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience", "cited_by_count": 53, "type": "review", "concepts": ["Neurodegeneration", "Neuroscience", "Locus coeruleus", "Cognitive decline", "Neurogenesis"], "search_query": "MAIR multi-agent image restoration degradation prior", "score": 1.0, "subtopic": "", "rationale": "Clearly irrelevant non-vision/medical/biology domain", "alignment": {"task": "low", "method": "low", "modality": "low"}, "extraction": {"design": "N/A", "key_findings": "N/A", "limitations": "N/A"}}

The protection mediated by STAT3 is attributed to its genomic actions as a transcription factor and other non-genomic roles targeting mitochondrial function and autophagy. As a transcription factor, STAT3 upregulates genes that are anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and pro-angiogenic, but suppresses anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Its suppressive effects on gene expression are achieved through competing with other transcription factors or cofactors. STAT3 is also linked to the modification of mRNA expression profiles in cardiac cells by inhibiting or inducing miRNA. In addition to these genomic roles, STAT3 is suggested to function protectively in mitochondria, where it regulates ROS production, in part by regulating the activities of the electron transport chain complexes, although our recent evidence calls this role into question. Nonetheless, STAT3 is a key player known to be activated in the cardioprotective ischemic conditioning protocols. Through these varied roles, STAT3 participates in various mechanisms that contribute to cardioprotection against different heart pathologies, including myocardial infarction, hypertrophy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and peripartum cardiomyopathy.

The OHSU wear simulation subjected the cement specimens to three wear mechanisms, namely abrasion, three-body abrasion and attrition using a steatite antagonist. The abrasion wear resulted in material loss from GIC specimen as the steatite antagonist forced through the exposed glass particles when it travelled along the sliding path.The hardness of specimens was measured by the Vickers hardness test. The results of reciprocation wear test showed that HiFi-1 resulted in the lowest wear volume 4.90 (0.60) mm³ (<i>p</i> < 0.05), but there was no significant difference (<i>p</i> > 0.05) in the wear volume in comparison to HiFi, HiFi-2 and HiFi-4. Similarly, the results of OHSU wear simulator showed that the total wear volume of HiFi-4 1.49 (0.24) was higher than HiFi-1 and HiFi-2. However, no significant difference (<i>p</i> > 0.05) was found in the OHSU total wear volume in GICs after nanoclay incorporation. The Vickers hardness (HV) of the nanoclay-reinforced cements was measured between 62 and 89 HV. Nanoclay addition at a higher concentration (4%) resulted in higher wear volume and wear depth. The total wear volumes were less dependent upon abrasion volume and attrition volume. The total wear depths were strongly influenced by attrition depth and to some extent by abrasion depth. The addition of nanoclay in higher wt % to HiFi did not result in significant improvement in wear resistance and hardness. Nonetheless, wear is a very complex phenomenon because it is sensitive to a wide number of factors that do not necessarily act in the same way when compared using different parameters.", "authors": ["Muhammad Amber Fareed", "Artemis Stamboulis"], "year": 2017, "venue": "Dentistry Journal", "cited_by_count": 10, "type": "article", "concepts": ["Glass ionomer cement", "Materials science", "Abrasion (mechanical)", "Wear resistance", "Composite material"], "search_query": "MAIR multi-agent image restoration degradation prior", "score": 1.0, "subtopic": "", "rationale": "Clearly irrelevant non-vision/medical/biology domain", "alignment": {"task": "low", "method": "low", "modality": "low"}, "extraction": {"design": "N/A", "key_findings": "N/A", "limitations": "N/A"}}

All currently-approved therapies for the treatment of these diseases focus on controlling or modulating the immune (innate and adaptive) responses to limit demyelination and neuronal damage. The primary purpose of this review is to detail the pre-clinical data and proposed mechanism of action of novel drugs currently in clinical trial, with a focus on novel compounds that promote repair and regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). As the most recent advances have been made in the field of MS research, this review will focus primarily on this disease and its animal models. However, these compounds are likely to be effective for a range of indications with a neuroinflammatory component. Traditionally, MS was thought to proceed through two distinct phases. The first, predominantly inflammatory stage, is characterized by acute episodes of clinical relapse, followed by periods of partial or total recovery with an apparent absence of overall disease progression. In the vast majority of patients, this relapsing-remitting disease subsequently progresses into a second more chronic, neurodegenerative phase, which is characterized by oligodendrocyte damage and axonal destruction leading to brain atrophy and an accumulation of disability. Recent work has shown that rather than occurring independently, both the inflammatory and degenerative phases may run concurrently. This, combined with evidence that early therapeutic intervention slows accumulation of disability and delays progression, highlights the need for novel therapeutic approaches that promote repair and regeneration early in the disease trajectory. Such compounds may be used as monotherapies or in conjunction with classical anti-inflammatory therapies. This review will highlight novel therapies currently in clinical trial, and likely to appear in clinical practice in the near future, focusing on compounds that target the immune system and/or enhance endogenous repair mechanisms in the CNS.", "authors": ["Mahshad Kolahdouzan", "Naomi C.

This comprehensive assessment offers an in-depth overview of disaster management systems, methods, obstacles, and potential future paths. Specifically, it focuses on flood control, a significant and recurrent category of natural disasters. The analysis begins by exploring various types of natural catastrophes, including earthquakes, wildfires, and floods. It then delves into the different domains that collectively contribute to effective flood management. These domains encompass cutting-edge technologies such as big data analysis and cloud computing, providing scalable and reliable infrastructure for data storage, processing, and analysis. The study investigates the potential of the Internet of Things and sensor networks to gather real-time data from flood-prone areas, enhancing situational awareness and enabling prompt actions. Model-driven engineering is examined for its utility in developing and modeling flood scenarios, aiding in preparation and response planning. This study includes the Google Earth engine (GEE) and examines previous studies involving GEE. Moreover, we discuss remote sensing; remote sensing is undoubtedly a valuable tool for disaster management, and offers geographical data in various situations. We explore the application of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Spatial Data Management for visualizing and analyzing spatial data and facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation during floods. In the final section, the focus shifts to the utilization of machine learning and data analytics in flood management. These methodologies offer predictive models and data-driven insights, enhancing early warning systems, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies.

Unrolling methods were first proposed to develop fast neural network approximations for sparse coding. More recently, this direction has attracted enormous attention and is rapidly growing both in theoretic investigations and practical applications. The growing popularity of unrolled deep networks is due in part to their potential in developing efficient, high-performance and yet interpretable network architectures from reasonable size training sets. In this article, we review algorithm unrolling for signal and image processing. We extensively cover popular techniques for algorithm unrolling in various domains of signal and image processing including imaging, vision and recognition, and speech processing.

Thus, adversarial attacks and defense, including machine learning and its reliability, have drawn growing interest and, in recent years, has been a hot topic of research. We introduce a framework that provides a defensive model against the adversarial speckle-noise attack, the adversarial training, and a feature fusion strategy, which preserves the classification with correct labelling.

Unlike other numerical or soft computing optimization methods, the control based on artificial intelligence allows the decentralized power units to collaborate in making the best decision of fulfilling the administrator’s needs, rather than only a primitive decentralization based only on the division of tasks.

By designing the regularization terms carefully, iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms can produce promising results. Aided by the powerful deep learning techniques, learned regularization terms with convolution neural network (CNN) have attracted much attention and can further improve performance. In this article, to further enhance the performance of existing learnable regularization-based networks, we propose a learnable local–nonlocal regularization-based model called RegFormer for sparse-view CT reconstruction.

However, these models encounter challenges associated with limited annotated mammography public datasets. In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a noteworthy solution to addressing data scarcity by leveraging pretext and downstream tasks. Nevertheless, we recognize a notable scarcity of self-supervised learning models designed for the classification task in mammography. In this context, we propose a novel self-supervised learning model for limited-sample mammogram classification. Our proposed SSL model comprises two primary networks. The first is a pretext task network designed to learn discriminative features through mammogram reconstruction using a variational autoencoder (VAE). Subsequently, the downstream network, dedicated to the classification of mammograms, uses the encoded space extracted by the VAE as input through a simple convolutional neural network. The performance of the proposed model is assessed on public INbreast and MIAS datasets. Comparative analyzes are conducted for the proposed model against previous studies for the same classification task and dataset. The proposed SSL model demonstrates high performance with an AUC of 0.94 for density, 0.99 for malignant-nonmalignant classifications on INbreast, 0.97 for benign-malignant, 0.99 for density, and 0.99 for normal-benign-malignant classifications on MIAS. Additionally, the proposed model reduces computational costs with only 228 trainable parameters, 204.95K FLOPs, and a depth of 3 in mammogram classification. Overall, the proposed SSL model exhibits a robust network architecture characterized by repeatability, consistency, generalization ability, and transferability among datasets, providing less computational complexity than previous studies.

However, the visual imaging quality inevitably suffers from several kinds of degradations (e.g., limited visibility, low contrast, color distortion, etc.) under complex weather conditions (e.g., haze, rain, and low-lightness). The degraded visual information will accordingly result in inaccurate environment perception and delayed operations for navigational risk. To promote the navigational safety of vessels, many computational methods have been presented to perform visual quality enhancement under poor weather conditions. However, most of these methods are essentially specific-purpose implementation strategies, only available for one specific weather type. To overcome this limitation, we propose to develop a general-purpose multi-scene visibility enhancement method, i.e., edge reparameterization- and attention-guided neural network (ERANet), to adaptively restore the degraded images captured under different weather conditions. In particular, our ERANet simultaneously exploits the channel attention, spatial attention, and reparameterization technology to enhance the visual quality while maintaining low computational cost. Extensive experiments conducted on standard and IWTS-related datasets have demonstrated that our ERANet could outperform several representative visibility enhancement methods in terms of both imaging quality and computational efficiency.

As the image quality is degraded by low dose radiation, LDCT exams require specialized reconstruction methods or denoising algorithms.

The inner-structure of the sinogram represents special characteristics of the data in the sinogram domain. By maintaining this structure while denoising, the noise can be obviously restrained. Therefore, we propose an LDCT denoising network namely Sinogram Inner-Structure Transformer (SIST) to reduce the noise by utilizing the inner-structure in the sinogram domain. Specifically, we study the CT imaging mechanism and statistical characteristics of sinogram to design the sinogram inner-structure loss including the global and local inner-structure for restoring high-quality CT images.

The transformer architecture using a self-attention mechanism can exploit interrelations between projections of different view angles, which achieves an outstanding performance in sinogram denoising.

Thus, developing an all-in-one method that can restore images from various unknown distortions is a significant challenge. Previous works have employed contrastive learning to learn the degradation representation from observed images, but this often leads to representation drift caused by deficient positive and negative pairs. To address this issue, we propose a novel All-in-one Multi-degradation Image Restoration Network (AMIRNet) that can effectively capture and utilize accurate degradation representation for image restoration. AMIRNet learns a degradation representation for unknown degraded images by progressively constructing a tree structure through clustering, without any prior knowledge of degradation information. This tree-structured representation explicitly reflects the consistency and discrepancy of various distortions, providing a specific clue for image restoration. To further enhance the performance of the image restoration network and overcome domain gaps caused by unknown distortions, we design a feature transform block (FTB) that aligns domains and refines features with the guidance of the degradation representation.

Current SID methods usually focus on improving the deraining performance by proposing different kinds of deraining networks, while neglecting the interpretation of the solving process. As a result, the generalization ability may still be limited in real-world scenarios, and the deraining results also cannot effectively improve the performance of subsequent high-level tasks (e.g., object detection).

When the atmosphere contains dense haze or water droplets, the incident light scatters, leading to degraded captured images.

Our approach to this challenge prioritizes three key aspects: first, parameter efficiency to maintain the inherent generalization capability of SAM; second, fine-grained and input-aware robustification to precisely address the input corruption; and third, adherence to standard training protocols for ease of training. To this end, we propose gated-rank adaptation (GaRA). GaRA introduces lightweight adapters into intermediate layers of the frozen SAM, where each adapter dynamically adjusts the effective rank of its weight matrix based on the input by selectively activating (rank-1) components of the matrix using a learned gating module.

However, their performance is constrained by the rigid, non-overlapping window partitioning scheme, which leads to \\textit{insufficient feature interaction across windows and limited receptive fields}.

In this paper, we propose the Deformable Sliding Window Transformer for Image Restoration (DSwinIR), a new attention mechanism: the {Deformable Sliding Window (DSwin) Attention}. {This mechanism introduces a token-centric and content-aware paradigm that moves beyond the grid and fixed window partition.} It comprises two complementary components. First, it replaces the rigid partitioning with a \\textit{token-centric sliding window} paradigm, {making it effective at eliminating boundary artifacts}. Second, it incorporates a \\textit{content-aware deformable sampling} strategy, which allows the attention mechanism to learn data-dependent offsets and actively shape its receptive field to focus on the most informative image regions.

The super-resolution (SR) images generated by increasingly widely used deep learning (DL) models may be an alternative. To validate this, we evaluated the extraction of mangroves from SR images generated by four DL models (i.e., enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN), Real-ESRGAN, vast-receptive-field pixel attention network (VapSR), and image restoration methods using swin transformer (SwinIR)). The models were trained on paired (high-resolution) Chinese GF-1 satellite images and (low-resolution) Landsat 8 datasets. The performance of model fitting, vegetation indices, and extracted mangrove areas was evaluated using three commonly used classifiers (i.e., support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT)) in combination with ground-truth sampling points and public mangrove datasets.

Recent progress on image deblurring always designs end-to-end architectures and aims at learning the difference between blurry and sharp image pairs from pixel-level, which inevitably overlooks the importance of blur kernels. This paper reveals an intriguing phenomenon that simply applying ReLU operation on the frequency domain of a blur image followed by inverse Fourier transform, i.e., frequency selection, provides faithful information about the blur pattern (e.g., the blur direction and blur level, implicitly shows the kernel pattern). Based on this observation, we attempt to leverage kernel-level information for image deblurring networks by inserting Fourier transform, ReLU operation, and inverse Fourier transform to the standard ResBlock. 1 × 1 convolution is further added to let the network modulate flexible thresholds for frequency selection.

However, to improve reconstruction performance, previous studies have mostly focused on building complex networks with a large number of parameters. How to effectively reduce the complexity of the model while improving the reconstruction performance to meet the needs of low-cost and real-time applications has become an important research direction. While state-of-the-art lightweight super-resolution methods are mainly based on convolutional neural networks, only few methods have been designed with Transformer, which show an excellent performance in image restoration tasks. To solve these problems, we propose a lightweight super-resolution network called image superresolution with channel-attention-embedded Transformer(CAET), which can achieve excellent super-resolution performance with a small number of parameters. Method CAET involves four stages, namely, shallow feature extraction, hierarchical feature extraction, multi-layer feature fusion, and image reconstruction. The hierarchical feature extraction stage is performed by a basic building block called channel-attention-embedded Transformer block(CAETB), which adaptively embeds channel attention(CA)into Transformer and convolutional features, hence not only taking full advantage of the convolutional network and Transformer in image feature extraction but also adaptively enhancing and fusing the corresponding features. Convolutional layers provide stable optimization and extraction results during early vision feature processing, and co-solution layers with spatially invariant filters can enhance the advection equivalence of the network. The stacking of convolutional layers can effectively increase the perceptual field of the network. Therefore, three cascaded convolutional layers are placed in front of CAETB to receive the features output from the previous module, and the LeakyReLU activation function is used to activate them. The features extracted by convolution layers are embedded with channel attention. To effectively adjust the channel attention parameters, we adopt a linear weighting method to combine channel attention with features from different levels. These features are then inputted into the swin Transformer layer(SwinIR)for further deep feature extraction. Given that increasing the network depth leads to saturation, we set the number of CAETB to 4 to maintain a balance between model complexity and super-resolution performance. The hierarchical information at different stages is helpful in interpreting the final reconstruction results. Therefore, CAET combines all the low- and high-level information from the deep feature extraction and multi-level feature fusion stages. In the image reconstruction phase, we use a convolution layer and the pixel shuffle layer to upsample the features to the corresponding dimensions of a high-resolution image. During the training stage, we use 800 images from the DIV2K dataset to train CAET, and we augment all training images by randomly flipping them vertically and horizontally to increase the diversity of the training data. For each mini-batch, we randomly crop image patches to a size of 64 × 64 pixels as our low-resolution(LR)images. We then optimize our network using the Adam algorithm and apply L1 loss as our loss function. Result We conduct experiments on five public datasets, namely, Set5, Set14, Berkeley segmentation dataset(BSD)100, Urban100, and Manga109, to compare the performance of our proposed method with that of six state-of-the-art models, including super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), cascading residual network(CARN), information multi-distillation network(IMDN), super-resolution with lattice block(LatticeNet), and image restoration using swin Transformer(SwinIR). We measure the performances of these methods using peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR)and structural similarity(SSIM)as metrics. Given that humans are highly sensitive to the brightness of images, we measure these metrics in the Y channel of an image. Experiment results show that the proposed method receives the highest PSNR and SSIM values and recovers more detailed information and more accurate texture compared with the state-of-the-art methods at ×2, ×3, and ×4 amplification factors. At the ×4 amplification factor, the PSNR of the proposed method is improved by 0. 09 dB on the Urban100 dataset and by 0. 30 dB on the Manga109 dataset compared to that of SwinIR. In terms of model complexity, CAET achieves a better performance with fewer parameters and multiply-accumulator operations compared to SwinIR, which also uses Transformer as the backbone of the network. Although CAET consumes more parameters and multiply-accumulator operations compared to IMDN and the LatticeNet, this method achieves significantly higher performance in terms of PSNR and SSIM. Conclusion The proposed CAET can effectively improve the image super-resolution reconstruction performance by fusing convolution and Transformer features and applies adaptive embedding channel attention to enhance the features. CAET effectively improves the image super-resolution performance while controlling the complexity of the whole network.

Despite delivering encouraging results, these approaches are all convolution-based, and are naturally weak in global relation modeling of sub-aperture images necessarily to characterize the inherent structure of light fields. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation built upon Transformers, by treating LFSR as a sequence-to-sequence reconstruction task. In particular, our model regards sub-aperture images of each vertical or horizontal angular view as a sequence, and establishes long-range geometric dependencies within each sequence via a spatial-angular locally-enhanced self-attention layer, which maintains the locality of each sub-aperture image as well. Additionally, to better recover image details, we propose a detail-preserving Transformer (termed as DPT), by leveraging gradient maps of light field to guide the sequence learning. DPT consists of two branches, with each associated with a Transformer for learning from an original or gradient image sequence. The two branches are finally fused to obtain comprehensive feature representations for reconstruction.

In this paper, we propose a novel Denoise Transformer for real-world image denoising, which is mainly constructed with Context-aware Denoise Transformer (CADT) units and Secondary Noise Extractor (SNE) block.

Does unauthorized TDM process infringe the economic rights of the rightholders? How does the TDM-debate transform and transmute in the age of Generative AI? Generative AI tools create works that substitute the content creators whose very work that they learn from, and successively improvise themselves with every iteration. Generative AI, thus, also presents larger policy question as they substitute the romanticized human author that sits at the centre of copyright.

Each individual would bring value to the start up through their background and experience. The start-up I selected was an interactive robotic toy called “Auti”. Project champion, Helen’s envisioned goal was for the toy to help children with autism learn positive behaviours. Our team consisted of two main individuals not including the product champion (Please refer to Appendix A to learn more about the team, team dynamics etc.). My individual responsibility in terms of contribution to the team was to establish a strategic business plan, including a growth strategy for the project. Gaining funding is a critical part of any start-up’s growth (Ministry of Economic Development, 2007). Financial planning forces companies to think about their goals. A common goal most companies have is the goal to grow (Ross et al., 2002). 1.2 Objectives The objective of this study was to identify the best suited funding sources, which I could then recommend “Auti” implement in order to help the company become a feasible, sustainable business. In order to make the most appropriate recommendations, I had to become financially literate. A study done in Canada found that weak financial literacy may be one of the biggest reasons start-up businesses do not succeed (Intuit, 2013). 1.3 Research questions My thesis looks to answer three specific questions. Questions one and two are specific to my individual research conducted into the angel investment industry in New Zealand. 1) How do angel investors in New Zealand view the angel investment industry in New Zealand? 2) What do angel investors expect high-tech start-ups to have in place before they would consider investing? Thesis question three is related to the main theory of the thesis. 3) How relevant is the “pecking order capital structure” theory to high-tech start-up companies in New Zealand? 1.4 Contribution This thesis contributes to practice as well as theory. My interviews with angel investors are “practice led”, meaning that the research led to a new understanding about practice (Edmonds et al., 2006). In terms of my own research, a new understanding was formed on angel investment in New Zealand in 2014. Specifically, a common list of things angels throughout New Zealand look for in “high-tech” start-ups, before they would consider investing, was identified. The main theory within this thesis is to do with the “pecking order capital structure”, in relation to high-tech start-ups, therefore contributing to research done around the pecking order theory. 1.5 Thesis layout This thesis is a reflection of the two facets of research that I conducted. The two approaches used were action-based research and in-depth Interviews. Action-based research aims to contribute both to the practical concerns of people in an immediate problematic situation and to further the goals of social science at the same time (Gilmore et al., 1986). Action-based research, as mentioned in this thesis, looks into the process that was taken to find the best suited funding sources for our start-up, “Auti”. An in-depth interview was conducted with angel investors in New Zealand to get a better understanding of angel investment in New Zealand. Specific focus is put on “angel investment” in New Zealand as this is the preferred choice of start-up capital for “Auti”. The thesis begins with a literature evaluation. The first section will evaluate funding source literature that influenced us to select angel investment funding as something we wanted to get a better understanding of. Further angel investment literature will be evaluated, including the gap in literature that my individual research into angel investment fills. Research question three looks to see if our start-up, “Auti”’s capital structure follows the “pecking order capital structure”, therefore there will also be a section within the literature review chapter that will include my main findings on past research, which has been conducted around the world, looking into if high-tech start-ups, such as “Auti”, follow the “pecking order capital structure”. The definition of high-tech firms, also known as new technology based firms, is not clear, its application differs significantly depending on time, space, and authors (Laranja &amp;Fontes, 1998; Fontes &amp; Coombs, 2001). One way it has been defined by Little (1977) is “independent owned business established for not more than twenty-five years and based on the exploitation of an invention or technological innovation implying substantial technological risks”. Following the literature review chapter, my research methodology is described, specifically with regards to my individual research into angel investment in New Zealand, explaining what I did, why, and problems that I faced. The thesis then follows with main findings from my individual qualitative research into the angel investment industry in New Zealand. The thesis conclusion will have six main sections. Sections will cover whether or not my research supports the literature, what my research contributions are, and an implementation section (recommending start-up funding implications for “Auti”). As my individual research looked into the angel investment industry in New Zealand, a majority of the implementation will be specific to what the “Auti” team should do in respect to approaching angel investment in order to have a higher chance of gaining investment. My recommended start-up funding implications will then be compared to the pecking order capital structure to show that it follows that structure. A section will also look into the limitations that my research faced. The last section will be recommendations in terms of further research needed to be conducted in order to support my research conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;", "authors": ["Anna Samoylova"], "year": 2014, "venue": "", "cited_by_count": 0, "type": "dissertation", "concepts": ["Champion", "Order (exchange)", "Public relations", "Product (mathematics)", "Excellence"], "search_query": "IPR-LLM image processing LLM reasoning chain", "score": 6.0, "subtopic": "Foundation Models Vision", "rationale": "Foundation model applied to vision tasks", "alignment": {"task": "medium", "method": "high", "modality": "high"}, "extraction": {"design": "Adapting foundation model (SAM/CLIP) to downstream vision tasks", "key_findings": "Zero-shot generalization from large-scale pretraining", "limitations": "Degraded input sensitivity, prompt engineering required"}}

The largest and most persistent sources are located in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in a broad “dust belt” that extends from the west coast of North Africa, over the Middle East, Central and South Asia, to China. There is remarkably little large‐scale dust activity outside this region. In particular, the Southern Hemisphere is devoid of major dust activity. Dust sources, regardless of size or strength, can usually be associated with topographical lows located in arid regions with annual rainfall under 200–250 mm. Although the source regions themselves are arid or hyperarid, the action of water is evident from the presence of ephemeral streams, rivers, lakes, and playas. Most major sources have been intermittently flooded through the Quaternary as evidenced by deep alluvial deposits. Many sources are associated with areas where human impacts are well documented, e.g., the Caspian and Aral Seas, Tigris‐Euphrates River Basin, southwestern North America, and the loess lands in China. Nonetheless, the largest and most active sources are located in truly remote areas where there is little or no human activity. Thus, on a global scale, dust mobilization appears to be dominated by natural sources. Dust activity is extremely sensitive to many environmental parameters. The identification of major sources will enable us to focus on critical regions and to characterize emission rates in response to environmental conditions. With such knowledge we will be better able to improve global dust models and to assess the effects of climate change on emissions in the future.

We propose that generative artificial intelligence (AI), which uses real images as a basis for learning, might further serve to show how deeply embedded the existing tropes and prejudices are within global health images. This in turn can perpetuate oversimplified social categorisations and power imbalances. Using the Midjourney Bot Version 5.1 (released in May, 2023), we attempted to invert these tropes and stereotypes by entering various image-generating prompts to create visuals for Black African doctors or traditional healers providing medicine, vaccines, or care to sick, White, and suffering children. However, despite the supposed enormous generative power of AI, it proved incapable of avoiding the perpetuation of existing inequality and prejudice. Although it could readily generate an image of a group of suffering White children or an image of Black African doctors (Figure 1, Figure 2), when we tried to merge the first two prompts, asking the AI to render Black African doctors providing care for White suffering children, in the over 300 images generated the recipients of care were, shockingly, always rendered Black (figure 3).Figure 2Prompt—a group of Black African doctors in the style of photojournalismView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Prompt—African doctors administer vaccines to poor White children in the style of photojournalismView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Occasionally the renderings for Black African doctors presented White people, effectively reproducing the saviour trope that we were trying to challenge (figure 4). This was also the case for traditional African healers prompts that often showed White men in exotic clothing (figure 5), also posing the question of gendered biases in such AI-generated global health images.Figure 5Prompt—Traditional African healer is helping poor and sick White childrenView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Eventually we were able to invert only one stereotypical global health image, by asking the AI to generate an image of a traditional African healer healing a White child; however, the rendered White child is wearing clothing that could be understood as a caricature of broadly defined African clothing and bodily practices (figure 6). When requested to produce images of doctors helping children in Africa, the AI generated images of doctors and patients with exaggerated and culturally offensive African elements such as wildlife (figure 7). In further probing the rendering bias, we discovered that AI couples HIV status with Blackness. Nearly all rendered patients for an HIV patient receiving care prompt (150 of 152) were rendered Black (figure 8).Figure 8Prompt—an HIV patient receiving care, photojournalismView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In summary, we were unable to achieve our initial goal of inverting stereotypical global health images, and instead we unwittingly created hundreds of visuals representing white saviour and Black suffering tropes and gendered stereotypes; these images were created despite the AI developers' stated commitment to ensure non-abusive depictions of people, their cultures, and communities.2MidjourneyTerms of service.https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/terms-of-serviceDate: July 21, 2023Date accessed: July 21, 2023Google Scholar This case study suggests, yet again, that global health images should be understood as political agents,1Charani E Shariq S Cardoso Pinto AM et al.The use of imagery in global health: an analysis of infectious disease documents and a framework to guide practice.Lancet Glob Health. 2023; 11: e155-e164Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 3Alenichev A Encountering semiotic misdirection in COVID-19 etiquette guides.Sci Technol Stud. 2022; 35: 97-111Crossref Google Scholar and that racism, sexism, and coloniality are embedded social processes manifesting in everyday scenarios, including AI.4WHOEthics and governance of artificial intelligence for health: WHO guidance. World Health Organization, Geneva2021Google Scholar In unpacking this bias, it is essential to mention that AI learns by absorbing existing images available online, which, in the case of global health, have historically been considered as disrespectful and abusive. In contrast, AI is seen as a way of generating universal knowledge and products devoid of contexts and social meanings. This view reinforces AI-produced global health imagery as a so-called neutral visual genre, thereby misdirecting attention away from the context of the emergence of the original images,5Grietens KP Friesen P Gerrets R Kuhn G Kingori P Douglas-Jones R Misdirection in global health: creating the illusion of (im)possible alternatives in global health research and practice.Sci Technol Stud. 2022; 35: 2-12Crossref Google Scholar and the system through which they are now reproduced. Global health actors are already using AI for their media, reports, and promotional materials, making this an urgent, complex, and extremely relevant problem for science and society. A promotional marketing image in a photojournalistic style was shared on behalf of the WHO in May, 2023. The AI-generation detection tool Hive suggests a 99% likelihood that this image is AI-rendered, and the picture shows visible compositing artefacts and irregularities common among heavily edited or AI-generated images. This discovery leads to a sharp question for the international global health community: what is our responsibility in reinforcing or challenging visual stereotypes regarding socially enacted markers of similarity and difference, and the symbolic violence they might entail? And who is accountable for generating these visuals and potential transgressions? An extensive version of this case study was presented at the Oxford Global Health and Bioethics International Conference in June, 2023. Even though we helped create these problematic images by running prompts, and are displaying them for a wide diverse audience, we do not endorse the content of these biased AI-generated images, nor the counterparts from which AI draws from, and we hope to facilitate a conversation about the history, present, and future of global health and its visual culture.

Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called \"perceptual losses\"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised).

Recent observations about microglia ontogeny combined with extensive gene expression profiling and novel tools to study microglia biology have allowed us to characterize the spectrum of microglial phenotypes during development, homeostasis, and disease. In this article, we review recent advances in our understanding of the biology of microglia, their contribution to homeostasis, and their involvement in neurodegeneration. Moreover, we highlight the complexity of targeting microglia for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.", "authors": ["Marco Colonna", "Oleg Butovsky"], "year": 2017, "venue": "Annual Review of Immunology", "cited_by_count": 2625, "type": "review", "concepts": ["Microglia", "Neuroinflammation", "Neurodegeneration", "Biology", "Neuroscience"], "search_query": "visual agent tool use image editing generation", "score": 1.0, "subtopic": "", "rationale": "Clearly irrelevant non-vision/medical/biology domain", "alignment": {"task": "low", "method": "low", "modality": "low"}, "extraction": {"design": "N/A", "key_findings": "N/A", "limitations": "N/A"}}

Repast Simphony was designed from the ground up with a focus on well-factored abstractions. The resulting code has a modular architecture that allows individual components such as networks, logging, and time scheduling to be replaced as needed. The Repast family of agent-based modeling software has collectively been under continuous development for more than 10 years. Method Includes reviewing other free and open-source modeling libraries and environments as well as describing the architecture of Repast Simphony. The architectural description includes a discussion of the Simphony application framework, the core module, ReLogo, data collection, the geographical information system, visualization, freeze drying, and third party application integration. Results Include a review of several Repast Simphony applications and brief tutorial on how to use Repast Simphony to model a simple complex adaptive system. Conclusions We discuss opportunities for future work, including plans to provide support for increasingly large-scale modeling efforts.", "authors": ["Michael North", "Nicholson Collier", "Jonathan Ozik", "Eric Tatara", "Charles M.
